<div class="drop-down-box" id="nick">
The reason I like pie is because of its simplicity, it is but delicious fruit, meat, vegetables, any of your choosing in a carbs rich casing. Use any element to open the dropdown menu, e.g. a, or element.

Use a container element (like) to create the dropdown menu and add the dropdown links inside it.
