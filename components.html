    In 2016, with the influence and support of major corporations and foreign bodies NSW Premier Mike Baird was able to implement laws prohibiting environmental protests.<br>
    This opened a path to unprecedented environmental destruction and severe corruption, along with a more authoritative government.<br>
    Corporations were able to increase their influence and they bought out many groups to further their causes, as did many politicians. With society so corrupt, crime became more prominent as politicians funded crime groups to further their policies.<br><br>

    This surge in the power of the upper class, led to the mass development of Sydney’s urban center and in a push for urban consolidation much of Sydney’s urban sprawl was demolished, forcing those people into the inner city and freeing up land for industrial construction.<br>
    These people forced into the city contributed to a much higher poverty rate and worsened crime. At first, Sydney’s police struggled to cope under the growing pressure but they were aided by new technologies and increased militarisation.<br><br>

    Then, when Donald Trump won the American election he took advantage of Australia’s newfound instability and close relationship to the USA. Most significantly he pressured the Australian government to discriminate against the Asian population, phasing in a new White Australia Policy.<br>
    Trump also sent US troops to Australia to enforce his will and establish further US power there.<br>
    As a result, many of Sydney’s Asians left the country, fearing for their welfare and lots more moved to Chinatown, which became a refuge for many Asians.<br><br>

    Now Sydney is a city consumed by it’s own greed, where extreme wealth lies right alongside extreme poverty. Crime and disorder are common as oppression and misfortune plagues many of the city’s residents, overwhelmed by their sudden fall from grace. Corrupt, selfish and indecisive, few politicians or leaders have risen to the challenge and Sydney spirals further down into anarchy.<br><br>

            <blockquote>"Every great story seems to start with a snake."</blockquote>

            When discrimination against Asians began, Nick, then a promising young lawyer, helped his friends Tongyi Shen and Jonathan Pan seek refuge in Chinatown. Here they happened upon a hidden Chinese syndicate, the Longying. Seeking protection and a means to empower themselves they joined their cause and spent years training there and immersing themselves in the syndicate.<br><br>
            During this time he lived in an apartment in Chinatown and completed his training as a lawyer, having long had a passion for the profession.
            However, as he worked in the business corruption became very evident and Nick was appalled. Coupled with this, due to his race, his work was made very difficult by the government and some of his coworkers, forcing himself to push himself hard to achieve anything.<br><br>
            Over this time the Longying became more powerful and conditions across the rest of Sydney worsened. Eventually Nick became so distraught with the state of the legal system he stopped his Longying training to commit to his profession and overcome the obstacles presented by his ethnicity.<br>
            While he was away a US raid crippled the Longying and Nick became furious.
            With the help of close friends, he put together his arsenal and left to become one of the first vigilantes, Viper.<br><br><br>

        With the help of his friends Jonathan sought refuge in Chinatown when discrimination against Asians began. Here, he, Nicholas Ramsay and Tongyi Shen met the Longying and joined them.<br>
        Jonathan was quick to commit to the group and fully believed in what they were doing. He felt it was his duty as a Chinese-Australian to aid the group’s cause so he trained wholeheartedly for many years. His weapon of choice was the monk’s spade and after learning what he could from the Longying staff master he proceeded to teach himself the finer points of the weapon.<br><br>
        He eventually travelled to China to meet a master of the weapon. In China Jonathan trained further and made a reputation for himself, even managing to convince some warriors to return to Sydney with him.<br>
        This laid the groundwork for Longying connections to China. When he returned to Sydney Jonathan quickly rose through the ranks of the Longying, gaining a seat on the council of elders despite his youth, and earning his title, Yang Jian, after a Chinese god. Jonathan embraced his title tattooing a third eye onto his forehead, as this ‘truth-seeing eye’ was a feature of the god.<br>
        Now Jonathan is one of the best warriors of the Longying and has committed entirely to the group, severing all former ties and fighting with the single mindset of liberating Sydney’s Chinese population.<br><br>

            With a name translating to ‘Shadow Dragon’, the Longying are an underground group of traditional Chinese warriors. They seek to liberate the Chinese population of Sydney.<br><br>
            Originally the group was small and based in a building near Darling Harbour but US forces discovered them and raided their base, killing many members and destroying important documents and items.
            Some Longying survived and moved to Paddy’s Market, which they were able to buy after securing a great sum of money from associates overseas. A secret underground level was built and here the Longying train in ancient weapons and martial arts.<br><br>
            They have a system of underground tunnels that link Paddy’s Market to a number of Longying controlled venues across the area, including laundromats and yum-cha restaurants.<br><br>
            They now have a strong influence in Chinatown but have escaped government attention, preferring to continue building their forces in secret. They have gained many followers and have some very well trained warriors.<br><br>
            Led by a council of elders, they have traditional practices and beliefs, following the teachings of Confucius.

            <h4 class="subtitle">Base</h4>
            The Paddy’s Market building has been redesigned with a more Oriental theme. The ground floor is a permanent marketplace (many shop-owners are Longying and may sleep in hammocks etc. behind the storefront) while the floor above is a storeroom.<br>
            Behind an ornate door guarded by warriors is a staircase leading down to the underground level. This level has many rooms such as training areas, dormitories, armouries and meeting areas.<br>Furthermore, secure doors guarded by warriors allow access to the underground tunnels that lead between bases.

                    A military helmet developed by DARPA, the BraveHelm is worn by soldiers and influences their brains: reducing stress, keeping focus and reducing pain by using transcranial pulsed ultrasound waves.<br><br>

                    However, magnetic nanoparticles (surgically implanted and heated by magnetic fields) are also discreetly used in conjunction with the BraveHelm, allowing for near-complete control of a soldier’s actions.<br>
                    The BraveHelm Alpha controls this, essentially giving the user mind control over soldiers under their command.<br><br>

                    The BraveHelm is black in colour and has a sliding face guard, allowing protection of the entire head. It is fairly bulky and noticeably geometric in shape. A narrow slit between the faceplate and the head guard allows the soldier to see.<br><br>
                    The BraveHelm Alpha is similar but has a glowing red alpha symbol roughly above the ears.

Throughout high school the majority of his peers disliked him for his selfish nature, characterised by a desire to improve his own quality of life despite any expense to others. These expenses were sometimes profound and Lewis made far more enemies than he did friends.<br>
            During these early years this had little affect on him and he brushed any regrets aside.<br><br>

            It was when he left school that reality hit home and in an attempt to escape and, to a minor degree, better himself; he enlisted in the Australian Defence Force. He made this decision following friends from his AFL team, a sport that had played a major part in his youth, as several of teammates also joined the military.<br>
            In the Defence Force Lewis’ humour and friendliness made him fast friends and he felt a sense of purpose and acceptance. The discipline of military training brought out the best in Lewis and his old self began to fade away in favour of a new persona, the spitting image of the ANZAC soldier.<br><br>

            After training he was deployed to Afghanistan where his newfound skills were put to the test. Lewis soon distinguished himself as a capable soldier and began to climb the ranks.<br>
            But then, against his better nature, he became obsessed with ranking up and began to fall back into his manipulative ways in order to do so.<br><br>

            <div class="drop-down-box" id="patton">
                In the army his best friend was Captain Grove, one of the AFL players Lewis had known during school and so when a rumour began to circulate of Grove’s imminent promotion Lewis was conflicted.
                Two days after this, the platoon was split up by a Taliban ambush. Patton and Grove took refuge from the gunfire in a nearby building where they found Corporal Marven, also taking shelter.<br>
                While Grove tried to contact backup Patton and Marven stood guard. Peering out at the war-torn street Patton realised a desire to escape the war and remembered Grove’s promotion. In a sudden decision he spun around and gunned down his best friend.<br>
                Marven opened fire at Patton and tried to call for backup but was silenced with a shot to the head.<br>
                Hearing gunfire quieting outside, Patton quickly hid the bodies and rushed after his retreating platoon. <br><br>

                He told his commanding officer that they had been attacked by a large group of Taliban and he had held them off, letting Marven and Grove escape, before turning to flee himself. He claimed he had seen them gunned down, only just managing to escape himself.<br>
                Fortunately for Lewis, they were never able to return to that town as the Taliban held it for a long time, letting his lie go by undetected, with Lewis promoted in Grove’s place, for his apparent bravery.<br><br>

                Soon he was sent home, with the comfortable rank of Major under his belt. Back in Sydney, with a desire to remain in the military, he found himself promoted to lead the newly established Fort Darling, built to enforce US will in Chinatown and begin the systematic discrimination effort against Asians.<br><br>

                Known in the army as a trusted and capable soldier he was also selected to trial the recently developed BraveHelms and with funding from the US Army, Fort Darling was soon stocked with a vast armoury, all of it under Patton’s command.<br>
                Finally granted with the power and comfort he’d sought, Patton was contempt and was happy to do whatever was asked of him in order to hold onto his position.<br><br>

                He was comfortable but for one thing. Alone at night memories of his actions come back to torment him and he is consumed by self-loathing and insecurity. Grove’s death in particular, deeply troubles Patton.<br>
                In the day though, Major Patton forces his insecurity aside and become the cool, calm and collected leader of Fort Darling.

                    A military helmet developed by DARPA, the BraveHelm is worn by soldiers and influences their brains: reducing stress, keeping focus and reducing pain by using transcranial pulsed ultrasound waves.<br><br>

                    However, magnetic nanoparticles (surgically implanted and heated by magnetic fields) are also discreetly used in conjunction with the BraveHelm, allowing for near-complete control of a soldier’s actions.<br>
                    The BraveHelm Alpha controls this, essentially giving the user mind control over soldiers under their command.<br><br>

                    The BraveHelm is black in colour and has a sliding face guard, allowing protection of the entire head. It is fairly bulky and noticeably geometric in shape. A narrow slit between the faceplate and the head guard allows the soldier to see.<br><br>
                    The BraveHelm Alpha is similar but has a glowing red alpha symbol roughly above the ears.

            Tongyi fled with his friends, Nick and Jonathan, to Chinatown when severe discrimination began. They remained in Chinatown as it was established as an Asian safe zone.
            They stumbled upon the Longying and joined the group. While Nick and Jonathan trained, Tongyi took on an administrative role and helped establish connections for the Longying, preferring it to a combat role.<br><br>
            He spent years working in restaurants across Chinatown and eventually opened his own restaurant outside of Chinatown. This restaurant was opened in Surry Hills and named the Lucky Moon.<br><br>
            Tongyi then proceeded to link his restaurant to the Longying’s tunnel system allowing his restaurant to act as a base of operations and exit from Chinatown. Tongyi has been very careful to remain in the good graces of authorities and takes extra precautions when helping the Longying.<br>
            He is a very close friend of Viper and looks out for his vigilante friend. Tongyi often advises and helps ground Viper though they are known to argue.

            <blockquote>"I have never yet heard of a murderer who was not afraid of a ghost."</blockquote>

            Hugo had dreamed of being a superhero since his childhood so when he saw an infomercial promising ‘amazing physical abilities' he leapt at the chance, signing up despite warnings from his friends and family. This rash decision was also influenced by recent bouts of depression, causing him to question his self-worth and seek ways to better it. <br><br>

            He was accepted and sent to a facility owned by the corporation, ExoCorp. Here he underwent tests and minor experiments for a while with no success. Hugo was disappointed and deemed the endeavour hopeless, deciding to stop attending his sessions. After not turning up for several appointments some of the Velvet Knights arrived at his home. Hugo, finally feeling wanted, was convinced to return to ExoCorp. So he followed the Knights outside where they forcibly detained Hugo and returned him to ExoCorp where his captors claimed he was too important to be allowed to leave.<br><br>

            Hugo was angry with himself for being tricked and resolved to be uncooperative with the scientists. As a result they drugged him and the rest of his time in the facility passed as a blur.<br>
            Eventually Hugo awoke in a room, alone but for Phillip Dean, the owner of ExoCorp, and as he came to was shocked to discover he had no physical form. He was startled but elated, figuring it was his promised ability. That was until he was told that so far the process had been irreversible at which point he flipped and tried and tried to get away. For some reason he was unable to escape and Dean eventually managed to calm him down, explaining that they believed the trigger was a mental process. Hugo concentrated hard and managed to revert to a tangible state.<br><br>
            <div class="drop-down-box" id="spectre">
                Dean then began to tell Hugo how amazing this power was and how beneficial it could be.<br>
                He learnt that the Dean’s plan was to keep him captive, in order to test more, ensuring it was viable, then distribute the technology globally with the goal of bettering society.
                Despite his apparent goodwill Hugo was disagreeable, not wanting to be tricked again or have his power lost in further experimentation so when a commotion erupted in another ward he seized the opportunity to escape, this time succeeding.<br>
                After successfully escaping he decided that it would be best to keep what had happened secret, so that people don’t know about the technology and don’t flock to the corporation wanting superpowers of their own.<br>
                Hugo also decided that he might as well become the superhero he had wanted to be so he snuck back into ExoCorp and stole the suit designed for him.<br>
                With this he became the Silver Spectre and began his campaign to stop the work of ExoCorp.

            ExoCorp is an Australian based science corporation specialising in bioengineering and particle physics. The corporation works with international companies to develop technologies for global benefit.
            Led by the enigmatic genius Philip Dean, the company has made many technological breakthroughs.
            ExoCorp performs many of its studies behind closed doors and has little public profile despite being recognised for many technologies.
            In addition, ExoCorp has very tight security. Dean funds the upkeep of a group of special operatives, agents known as the Velvet Knight who are responsible for containing and protecting assets.
            ExoCorp was responsible for the P-3 experiments, which gave rise to the Experimentals and began a new and more sinister period for the company, with security increased exponentially and the Velvet Knights deployed to recapture the Experimentals.

            <blockquote>"The monster was the best friend I ever had."</blockquote>

            Throughout his adolescence Dylan had a deep interest in biotechnology so upon graduating high school he pursued this and his innovative ideas and outstanding results quickly gained him recognition. With this came a high position working for the corporation ExoCorp.

            Here he assisted the work of Philip Dean, helping the company with many of their inventions and the company made great technological developments.
            In his personal life, however, he took up wrestling to relieve some of the stress of his work and personal life, characterized by unsuccessful relationships.
            One such relationship was that with Daniel Watson, an intern who Dylan immediately disliked and made life difficult for, eventually having him fired.
            Dylan found a way to take out this frustration, fighting in the wrestling ring and he gradually became more invested, particularly in the infamous Wrestling Society. Here he adopted the alias of the Red Rhino and was fairly successful in his fights, unleashing his discontent in the underground fights.

            Then Daniel Watson, with a loan from his wealthy father, took over the Wrestling Society, largely to get back at Dylan. Twisted and now powerful, Daniel forced Dylan to begin work on a series of performance-enhancing drugs, to up the stakes of the fights.
            Unable to act otherwise, Dylan began using the ExoCorp facilities to work on these drugs: known as the AB3 Series.
            <div class="drop-down-box" id="rhino">
                They became immensely potent over the course of their development, often with crippling side effects, but Dylan managed to perfect one, naming it Substax. This drug caused exponential growth in the user and toughened their skin but had the side effects of causing the user’s veins to glow red while in use and leading to irritation and mood swings.

                Dylan began using Substax in the wrestling ring for Daniel had been growing violently impatient. However, back at ExoCorp his superiors noticed his strange behaviour and discovered the AB3 drugs. Dean was furious and immediately fired Dylan.
                Dylan was distraught and rapidly became destitute, blowing his money on alcohol and falling back on wrestling to earn money. Fortunately, he had a vast supply of Substax at his home, which helped fuel his wrestling and a growing dependence on the drug.

                It was at this point that the Silver Spectre came into his life, having heard of Dylan from Sergeant Jonah Riley. Having found it unable to achieve anything on his own, and keen to form a team, Hugo was able to convince Dylan to join him and take a stand against ExoCorp.
                Hugo helped Dylan regain his reputation and they became very close friends quickly as they began working together against ExoCorp.
                It also soon became clear that Dean had taken the AB3 drugs for his own purposes and Dylan resolved to reclaim them, fearing what Dean might achieve with his creations.

            <blockquote>"Science never solves a problem without creating ten more."</blockquote>

            Philip was raised by his father after his mother died of cancer. He became very introverted and during school devoted himself to his studies. He excelled academically and eventually founded a company of his own.

            This company, ExoCorp, was a scientific organisation focused on bioengineering with the aim of helping humanity, in part a personal reconciliation for his mother’s death.
            ExoCorp became very successful, pioneering a range of technologies as one of the leaders in the scientific community. With this Philip gained worldwide recognition.

            Dean’s influence grew with ExoCorp’s and he hired the Velvet Knights to maintain the company’s security, paranoid that an accident would compromise his work, and figuring they could also help support the police force.

            Gradually however, ExoCorp’s methods became much more sinister as Dean began to reason that the limitations the law and ethics placed on science only inhibited the progress and ultimately, the good, he was sure he was capable of.
            So Dean, assuring himself that he was doing something future generations would thank him for began a new, confidential and unrestricted department of the company, tossing aside most legal and ethical boundaries to push the limits of science.

            Then, in perhaps his most significant breakthrough, Philip began experimenting with applying particle physics to biotechnology and secretly began the P-2 experiments, which led to the creation of Experimentals like Silver Spectre.
            But then the Experimentals escaped.<br><br><br>

            The Velvet Knights are an elite force of hitmen-for-hire, offering their services to the side of wealth over that of morality. As a 0result the group has become notorious amongst the criminal underworld for their brutal yet effective techniques in carrying out the requests of their employers. Formed in the UK, the group has since increased in size and scale and has established a solid presence in Australia, abandoning their country of origin. Recently, they have grown a reputation in Sydney under the employment of Philip Dean and ExoCorp.<br><br><br>

        <h4 class="subtitle">History</h4>
        Following the Kray Brother’s brief arrest and release in January of 1965, criminal gangs in London became fearful of heightened police caution towards their illegal activities. It was due to this that the Richardson and Kray Twins gangs became eager to form some sort of discreet alliance that would allow them to continue their activities without the crimes being traced back to either faction.<br>
        This alliance came in the form of a new group known as the Velvet Knights, which both gangs controlled.<br><br>
        The Knights consisted of the collaborating gangs best men who went by the codenames of the Knights of the Round Table in order to remain as discreet as possible. Of these men, the most notable was Felix Haycock, the first Arthur of the Knights, along with Alastair Hughes who was selected for his brutal boxing skills and tough physique (despite being as young as 17 at the time).<br><br>

        The main use for this newly formed group was to carry out the more dangerous jobs tasked to the gangs. This ensured no trace of any severe crime could be linked to either main gang. It was thanks to this partnership that both gangs were able to evade police suspicion for some time as they were focused on catching this mysterious new ‘blood-suits gang.’ The Knights proved to be more efficient than originally intended, with no member ever apprehended or killed.<br><br>

            All ran smoothly throughout 1965. The Richardson and Kray Brothers gangs were able to continue their own operations while the Velvet Knights bore the load of the riskier work. However, this came to an end in late December of the same year after a fight broke out between multiple members of either gang during a Christmas party at the Astor Club. This sparked a long and intense turf war between both gangs, destroying their prior alliance and leaving the Velvet Knights without leadership or control. Due to this the Knights were free to distance themselves from either gang and took out on their own, looking for employment elsewhere.<br><br>

            Throughout the 20th century the Velvet Knights fell under the leadership of multiple gangs, corporations and political figures within Europe, carrying out their dirty work with the utmost efficiency and style. More often than not, the only reason for the Knights to ever switch their allegiance to another employer was either when a greater price was offered or if their current hirer was killed (usually the knights would off their bosses if pay became unreliable).<br><br>
            The group became adaptive with their business, quickly replacing lost members and building their own reputation, with their signature red suits and haunting methods striking fear into any target they were set upon.<br>
            By the beginning of the 21st century the Knights were still going strong, but the only remaining one of the original knights was Alastair Hughes, who had progressed to Arthur and felt a deep connection to the group of which his life had revolved around for the last 36 years.<br><br>

            In 2004 the Velvet Knights opted to migrate to Sydney, Australia, in an effort to establish a presence in a new and promising market.<br>
            This decision proved astute as it was within the same year that they were profitably employed by Philip Dean on behalf of ExoCorp. Despite the knights not being totally on board with Dean’s methods, the pay and technological benefits massively outweighed any negatives.<br>
            Now the Velvet Knights work as ExoCorp’s private security force and elite operative team, primarily tasked with containing the escaped Experimentals.<br>

            Born with an intellectual disability into a very wealthy family, Daniel lived an extremely privileged life from the start. His father was a successful financial consultant and Daniel grew up with everything he desired, becoming accustomed to getting his way.<br><br>

            As a result it was challenging for Daniel to adjust to the high school setting. He was quickly targeted for his eccentricities and was suddenly faced with people who did not bend to his will. Daniel was also disliked at school due to his political beliefs, which were notably right wing.<br>
            Daniel leeched off his parents’ affluence to survive adolescence and it was only with subtle coercing that his mother and father persuaded Daniel to find work as a young adult. His father, now on a contract with upcoming company ExoCorp, secured an internship there for his son.<br><br>

            At ExoCorp, Daniel was assigned to work with leading bioengineer, Dylan Jenkin, but Jenkin immediately despised his outspoken and arrogant intern and had him dismissed.<br>
            However in the time that they had been together Daniel learnt of a group called the Wrestling Society, which Jenkin frequented.<br>
            Seeing a way to get back at Dylan Daniel got a sizeable sum of money from his relatively submissive parents and bought the Wrestling Society. Daniel had the former owners discreetly killed and the society’s home building revamped.<br>

            Growing in power, Daniel forced his father to work as a consultant for his new business and together they brought a heavy gambling aspect into the Society, enabling them to turn a large profit.<br>
            Now Daniel reigns gleefully over the Wrestling Society as its ‘director.’ He has almost complete control over everyone involved with the Society. He is greatly aided by his wealth to fund his project.<br>
            Daniel also has an interest in new technologies, especially those developed by ExoCorp and it was from here that he had his trademark fists stolen, dubbing himself Gilgamesh, after the demigod.<br><br><br>

            Hugo was reluctant but decided to see what could be done and eventually managed to locate Dylan Jenkins, the man behind the Red Rhino.<br> Realising the gravity of Dylan’s situation, Hugo set out to help him and was successful, securing Dylan’s help in the fight against ExoCorp, with the two  becoming very close friends.<br><br>
            Soon after, Jonah realised his close friend Mockingbird would be a beneficial member to the growing team and he suggested she seek out Hugo and Dylan. Siena was readily taken in by Spectre after discrediting Dylan’s suspicions.<br><br>

            Inspired by his love for superheroes, Hugo declared the group the Sydney Guard and together the newly formed group began their campaign for Sydney.

            Then sitting at rank 6, Dylan climbed up to rank 2 and negotiated with the ruler of the Society, Daniel Watson, making a deal for his purchase of a disused part of Watson’s complex, (located on Military Road in Neutral Bay).<br><br>
            Dylan made some minor renovations to the space, enhancing it as a base of operations for the Sydney Guard.<br>
            Inside there is a small wrestling ring surrounded by a number of seats, along with a locker room and a small private conference room. A tiny safe-room, used to hold gambling money during fights is also present.<br>
            As such, the space serves as an ideal base for the Guard and provides a source of income, with Dylan teaching wrestling/self-defence lessons for civilians.

            <blockquote>"I am convinced that God does not play dice."</blockquote>

            In his gap year Jack went to Vegas with some friends who were keen gamblers. He stumbled into a high stakes gambling tournament, mistaken for one of the participants because of an expensive suit given to him by his grandfather.<br>
            The match was in fact a controlled game in which Ruby Keeler Milne and the Les Apaches were trying to identify an undercover cop while swindling a business tycoon. Jack is spotted and Ruby is very irritated but ignores him to focus on the game. Meanwhile Jack, inspired by the antics of his friends, tries to scam the businessman who immediately spots the trick and escapes, ruining the Apache’s gig.<br>
            Ruby is exceptionally annoyed by Jack and curses him with bad luck, tossing him out of the club where some Apaches beat him up. A few days he leaves Vegas with his friends.<br><br>
            Years later, hitchhiking across America Jack Kitchin ended up in Las Vegas. He hadn’t returned since his last visit, so when he was thrown out of a pickup truck in the middle of Sin City he was forced to improvise.<br><br>
            Jack went to the nearest casino and bet his $48 in a game of poker. However, he was no match for even the beginners in Vegas and had soon lost all his money and some. Kitchin crawled out the toilet window to escape and was beaten up by the security guard waiting outside. Jack spent the night in the police station.<br><br>
            The next morning he was spoken to by a stoned gambling counsellor, given $100 and sent on his way. He worked in a fast food shop for a few weeks, earning money to keep travelling.<br>
            Eventually he was stocked up and ready to move on. He bought a phone and called his family back in Sydney. Not having heard from him in weeks they were elated to hear from him but urged him to fly back home for his brother’s wedding, which had been pushed forward due to an accidental pregnancy.<br><br>
            Jack caught a cab to the airport and tried to book a ticket for home but he was one dollar short and no one wanted to give him any money. So he stole some from a wishing well and returned to the booking desk. Unfortunately, while he was looking for money his plane had left and the next one was delayed until the next day. He arrived late for the wedding but rushed for the church nonetheless, arriving even later due to heavy traffic.<br><br>
            The church was empty except for a priest and a young man who introduces himself as Cole Johnson and is revealed to be the Cosmologist. Being the only people in the church Jack and Cole (aware of Ruby’s curse and the future importance of Jack) talk.<br>
            After a long discussion Cole grants Jack the power of probability manipulation, intending to use Jack to help get back at Ruby, with whom he has a personal vendetta and recognising Jack’s potential in aiding his cause.<br>
            Jack was overjoyed with his new power and after a brief family reunion and a half-hearted promise to Cole to use it well, he heads back to Las Vegas.<br><br>
            Finally master of his own fortunes and eager to ‘beat’ Vegas Jack exploits his power to win enormous sums of money and enjoys the high life by assorting with the lowlife. Jack’s newfound luck sees him dating four women at once and rolling in money, with a posse of bodyguards at his side.<br>
            During this time he bought an antique Sedgley OSS at an auction, fascinated by the weapon. He had it modified and it became his signature possession. Very quickly Jack had become one of the kings of Vegas.<br>
            But it was not to last. Jack wasn’t aware of his power’s limitations. He had become too cocky and challenged Red Pig, another gambling tycoon, to a game of poker. Showing off, Jack went all in with everything he had, despite having terrible cards. He tried to use his power to make Red Pig fold, but unbeknownst to Jack, because the probability was far too low it didn’t work. Kitchin started bleeding profusely from his nose and was struck by a devastating headache. Dizzy and on the verge of fainting Jack watched as Red Pig revealed his cards and took all of Jack’s hard earned fortune.<br>
            Then Jack fainted.<br><br>
            Cole found him in hospital and scolded Jack for misusing his powers and breaking his promise. Jack meekly apologised and Cole ordered him to return to Sydney to fulfil his side of their deal.
            Jack took what little of his success was left and travelled home with Cole to try and use his powers for good.<br><br><br>

            <blockquote>"Better three hours too soon than a minute too late."</blockquote>

            As a young man in the 1940’s Cole lived in Paris. He had just returned from the war and as was his disposition, fell in love with a man, Raphael. <br>
            As young Parisian intellectuals they found their way into the social elite and mingling with philosophers, scientists and writers.<br><br>
            One evening, they found themselves in one of the local bars accompanied by a group of musicians. The bar was run by Les Apaches, of which the musicians were a part. Head of that society was Ruby Keeler-Milne.<br>
            The full bar and summer night had all in good spirits. Cole and Raphael slunk outside for a private moment (homosexuality was frowned upon by the French elite). Little did they know that one the most outspoken homophobes was watching from a balcony above. Ruby Keeler-Milne, (also leader of the street gang by the same name [Les Apaches]) saw the lovers and was appalled.<br>
            So she sent one of her men down and had Raphael shot. Cole was kept alive and ordered to spread the word that gays weren’t allowed in Ruby’s Paris. He was beaten, scolded and sent on his way.<br><br>
            Cole realised that it really was Ruby’s Paris, she controlled both the elite and the underworld, so he left. Before leaving he snuck back to the bar to retrieve Raphael’s body, which he wrapped in blankets and carried through the streets of Paris.<br>
            He buried his lover’s body outside a church in the Parisian countryside with the help of the priest, an old man by the name of Father Hargreaves.<br>
            Having nowhere else to go, Cole took up residence in the church and the two men soon became friends. Cole’s passion for science and philosophy was challenged by the father’s passion for religion. Hargreaves had an avid interest for all manner of faiths, though Christianity was his calling.<br>
            Together they read, worked, taught and preached and two years passed in contentedness. Yet the priest gradually did less and less, until the winter of the second year when he finally caved in.<br>
            Father Hargreaves was confined to bed and Cole took over the day-to-day running of the church, praying for his health. He prayed in vain.<br><br>
            On his deathbed Father Hargreaves took off his ring and gave it to Cole. It was a smooth gold band wrapped around a tiny gemstone, coloured like an opal, but with a million tiny points of colour.<br>
            On his deathbed, the priest told Cole that he was two hundred years old, one of the last in a dying group, blessed with the powers of creation to do the work of the gods. The ring was a power centre, he explained, but not the source of his power. That, he believed, came from the gods.<br><br>
            Understandably sceptical, Cole trudged through the winter drizzle and buried Hargreaves in the graveyard alongside Raphael. Having placed the priest in the grave he looked up from his work to see several men and women standing around him.<br>
            Uncaring, Cole finished burying the priest and threw down his shovel, heading back into the church. He opened the church doors to see the mourners inside, dry and silent but for a mutter that ominous, echoed through the pews, ‘he found an heir.’<br>
            Cole started forward but found himself unable to move, watching as the mourners slowly left whispering, some in languages he understood: ‘what a shame,’ ‘how unfortunate,’ and as the last of them left ‘she’s here.’<br><br>
            With that, Cole’s paralysis ended and he collapsed onto the church floor as boot heels clicked up the stairs outside. Ruby Keeler-Milne entered the church, took one look at Cole and left, leaving a trail of mud on the wooden floor.<br>
            Cole staggered to his feet and rushed outside into the rain leaping at Ruby. He fell face-first in the mud. Looking up, he saw hundreds of copies of Ruby surrounding him.<br>
            He felt heat and looked down to see his ring sinking into the mud and he snatched for it but was dragged backwards by the illusions of Ruby while the real Ruby reached for the ring.<br>
            The moment she touched it time froze. A perfect silence began and the universe seemed to shrink and become distant as Cole and Ruby, unaffected, reached for the ring. Cole spotted a similar ring on Ruby’s hand a second (or an hour) before both shattered and the universe burst back to life. Ruby fell back and Cole grabbed the marble sized gemstone, which had replaced the rings in the mud.<br>
            He stuffed it in his pocket and lay back panting as Ruby stumbled to her car and glared at him, driving away furiously.<br><br>
            Years passed. Cole stayed in the church for many of them. He read Father Hargreaves’ journals, gardened and ran the church but it wasn’t the same, and he didn’t feel like a priest. Over this time, Cole also slowly became familiar with his newfound powers and discovered what he was capable of.<br>
            Soon Cole became restless, eager to see the world and learn more about it and his power.
            He travelled far and wide and he saw and learnt much. He saw the future and he understood the past but as the world moved forward he moved with it and as science did the same he found some explanations for what he was.<br><br>
            At the turn of the century Cole arrived in Sydney and finding no other interdimensionals there, decided to stay, making a fresh start in a city he could watch over, a city where he had forseen much was to happen.<br><br><br>

            <blockquote>"Belief in the absence of illusions is itself an illusion."</blockquote>

            In 1897 Ruby was born into a peasant family in a small German village. Her father left early so she grew up under the care of her mother, a resilient and determined woman.<br>
            At age 17, with the outbreak of the First World War, Ruby felt a need to combat the overwhelming masculinity of the war along with the expectations of her community. She cut her hair and enlisted in the army, setting out to prove she was just as capable as anyone.<br><br>
            She skilfully deceived her comrades and higher ups, fighting in the war for three long years until, fighting in France, she found herself stuck behind enemy lines after a failed infiltration mission.<br>
            Ruby was soon captured by a fireteam of American soldiers and was raped. The cavalry didn’t come. This, for the most impactful time in her life showed her the failure of humanity and began that philosophy central to her character, existentialism.<br>
            Ruby was taken back to a prisoner of war camp, forced to care for the wounded. Here she met another woman, Nurse Roth, who she became unwilling friends with.<br>
            As the war drew to a close she told Roth about her rape and Roth, seeing a chance to continue her legacy and give Ruby back the dignity and power she had lost gave Ruby a ring, and like Father Hargreaves, passed on her power to the first of a new generation of interdimensionals. And that was how Ruby gained the ability to bend the first three dimensions to her will.<br><br>


            By the time the war had drawn to a close, a powerful Ruby had arrived in Paris, determined to lead a new life of which she was in command. Having come to the realisation that to her all that mattered was her own success she was ready to do so; in spectacular fashion.<br>
            Over the coming years she tried several approaches to gain the influence she sought and eventually, making the most of a fortunate coincidence, drew together the Les Apaches (one part a gang of street thugs, the other a society of writers and musicians, both of which had chosen the same name). Ruby infiltrated both groups and adopted positions of power in each, allowing her to gradually integrate them by mixing and matching members and events, blurring the two groups into one and granting her control over both Paris' poor and aristocracy.<br><br>
            Then came the night that set the Cosmologist on his path. At the Les Apaches club in Paris Ruby had Cole's lover, Raphael, shot. This was the first time she had killed someone outside of war. At this point, a council ran the Les Apaches, and Ruby having manoeuvred to control a sizeable portion of the gang, was forced to appeal to them to retain her command.<br>
            The meeting was going unsuccessfully, with the Apaches challenging Ruby’s capacity to lead, with strong sexist undertones. Finding it necessary to keep them alive to stabilise the gang Ruby was forced to prove herself to them. Noticing Cole and Raphael in the courtyard she feigned nonchalantly ordered Raphael killed, succeeding in impressing the Apache leaders by displaying her commitment and ruthlessness.<br>
            Despite her apparent nonchalance the act took a toll on Ruby’s conscience, solidifying her commitment to her new lifestyle and preluding her view of people as means to an end.<br><br>
            Over these years her power grew, and she met and was feared by other interdimensionals, including Father Hargreaves, whose funeral she attended, clashing with Cole in the process. Cole unwittingly destroyed Ruby's ring, severely limiting her power.<br>
            Growing sick of Paris, eager to get her strength back, and wary of retaliation by Cole, Ruby left, travelling with some of the Les Apaches to Las Vegas.<br>
            In Vegas she sought out Weaver, a cosmic entity with the capacity to manipulate the higher dimensions. Weaver, fallen on hard times in the big city, agreed to work for Ruby (who at least had a vision) in exchange for a sizeable income stream (Weaver was a keen drug-user and loved the simple satisfaction of money).<br><br>
            In Vegas Keeler-Milne set up another base of operations for the Apaches, who worked the casino scene to raise money for their operations in both Paris and Vegas.<br>
            Setting out on her own, Ruby hunted interdimensionals across America, killing them and stealing whatever power sources they had.<br>
            Returning to Vegas she had Weaver create her dress from the power sources she had collected. With her power and more returned, Ruby was satisfied and stayed in Vegas; ensuring operations went smoothly and Weaver didn’t go rogue. Then Will arrived.<br><br>
            As a Sydney politician he had come to Vegas on a business trip and Ruby saw an opportunity. Forced to come to one of her casinos to please a support group he met Ruby and was smitten. Seizing the chance, Ruby slid him into the palm of her hand and within days found herself in one of the most powerful positions in Sydney, the new frontier for her formidable empire.<br><br><br>

                        <li>Ruby’s central theme is of the empowerment of women. She is self-made, remarkably resilient, and hugely independent.
Her decision to fight in WWI shows that commitment to independence, as well as reflecting the idea of illusions and deception prominent in her story.<br>
Her rape marks one of the most disturbing and important events for her character. The fact that it occurred at the hands of the supposed good guys (the Allies) dramatically highlights the ambiguity of war, particularly World War I (which was a sort of uber-masculine atrocity contest). This, the fact that even the ‘good guys’ can do such severe wrong, leads to Ruby’s outlook on humanity as well as foreshadowing Cole’s actions at the conclusion of Jack Stage 1.<br>
Her outlook on humanity is fairly complex. Essentially, she sees people as tools, unaware of themselves and others. Her rape was a direct attack on her moral compass, leaving her confused and hopeless, unsure about morality and horrified at the damage individuals can do.<br>
All of this combined to create her existentialism, a feeling of hopeless in a universe where her actions will not be judged by any heavenly power (her rejection of religion contrasting Cole and Hargreaves’ acceptance and strength of it), and therefore no consequences for any actions. This also helps explain her disregard for human-life for in an uncaring universe nothing is sacred.<br>
Since that atrocity and her attempt to hide her femininity during the war she embraced it and lived the rest of her life parading it, in the light of her accomplishments and great influence.

            Will had always felt a profound and genuine duty to make the world a better place. Compassionate, egalitarian and recognising his high quality of life and potential, Will decided early on that he had a duty to throw himself head-first into Australia’s political battleground.<br>
            It is a testament to Will’s character that he was able to do this, for politics is undoubtedly a relentless and soul-destroying enterprise. But Will had sworn to himself that he would not be swayed, that despite all opposition he would remain true to himself and his goal, to create a political system that inspired hope.<br><br>
            Salkeld applied himself hard and found a position in the Labour Party. Despite the pressure, Will’s negotiation skills helped him gain a range of supporters in key electorates, allowing him to become an important member of the party without making moral sacrifices.<br>
            Then, in 2020, Will was elected into the House of Representatives and he was finally able to begin properly working to his goal.<br><br>
            In parliament, Will works furiously to do what little he can to bring about change and he has had some small but significant victories: tweaking the wording of bills, swaying votes, covering up beneficial laws and acting as a de facto negotiator between parties.<br>
            But everything became much more complicated when on a business trip in Las Vegas Will Salkeld met Ruby Keeler-Milne and fell head over heels in love. Ruby saw an opportunity and Will brought her back to Sydney, unaware of the force he was unleashing on his beloved city.<br><br><br>
