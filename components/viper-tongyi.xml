Tongyi fled with his friends, Nick and Jonathan, to Chinatown when severe discrimination began. They remained in Chinatown as it was established as an Asian safe zone.
They stumbled upon the Longying and joined the group. While Nick and Jonathan trained, Tongyi took on an administrative role and helped establish connections for the Longying, preferring it to a combat role.<br><br>
He spent years working in restaurants across Chinatown and eventually opened his own restaurant outside of Chinatown. This restaurant was opened in Surry Hills and named the Lucky Moon.<br><br>
Tongyi then proceeded to link his restaurant to the Longyingâ€™s tunnel system allowing his restaurant to act as a base of operations and exit from Chinatown. Tongyi has been very careful to remain in the good graces of authorities and takes extra precautions when helping the Longying.<br>
He is a very close friend of Viper and looks out for his vigilante friend. Tongyi often advises and helps ground Viper though they are known to argue.
