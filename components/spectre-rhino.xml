            <blockquote>"The monster was the best friend I ever had."</blockquote>

            Throughout his adolescence Dylan had a deep interest in biotechnology so upon graduating high school he pursued this and his innovative ideas and outstanding results quickly gained him recognition. With this came a high position working for the corporation ExoCorp.

            Here he assisted the work of Philip Dean, helping the company with many of their inventions and the company made great technological developments.
            In his personal life, however, he took up wrestling to relieve some of the stress of his work and personal life, characterized by unsuccessful relationships.
            One such relationship was that with Daniel Watson, an intern who Dylan immediately disliked and made life difficult for, eventually having him fired.
            Dylan found a way to take out this frustration, fighting in the wrestling ring and he gradually became more invested, particularly in the infamous Wrestling Society. Here he adopted the alias of the Red Rhino and was fairly successful in his fights, unleashing his discontent in the underground fights.

            Then Daniel Watson, with a loan from his wealthy father, took over the Wrestling Society, largely to get back at Dylan. Twisted and now powerful, Daniel forced Dylan to begin work on a series of performance-enhancing drugs, to up the stakes of the fights.
            Unable to act otherwise, Dylan began using the ExoCorp facilities to work on these drugs: known as the AB3 Series.
            <div class="drop-down-box" id="rhino">
                They became immensely potent over the course of their development, often with crippling side effects, but Dylan managed to perfect one, naming it Substax. This drug caused exponential growth in the user and toughened their skin but had the side effects of causing the userâ€™s veins to glow red while in use and leading to irritation and mood swings.

                Dylan began using Substax in the wrestling ring for Daniel had been growing violently impatient. However, back at ExoCorp his superiors noticed his strange behaviour and discovered the AB3 drugs. Dean was furious and immediately fired Dylan.
                Dylan was distraught and rapidly became destitute, blowing his money on alcohol and falling back on wrestling to earn money. Fortunately, he had a vast supply of Substax at his home, which helped fuel his wrestling and a growing dependence on the drug.

                It was at this point that the Silver Spectre came into his life, having heard of Dylan from Sergeant Jonah Riley. Having found it unable to achieve anything on his own, and keen to form a team, Hugo was able to convince Dylan to join him and take a stand against ExoCorp.
                Hugo helped Dylan regain his reputation and they became very close friends quickly as they began working together against ExoCorp.
                It also soon became clear that Dean had taken the AB3 drugs for his own purposes and Dylan resolved to reclaim them, fearing what Dean might achieve with his creations.
