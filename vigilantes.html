                            In 2016, with the influence and support of major corporations and foreign bodies NSW Premier Mike Baird was able to implement laws prohibiting environmental protests.<br>
                            This opened a path to unprecedented environmental destruction and severe corruption, along with a more authoritative government.<br>
                            Corporations were able to increase their influence and they bought out many groups to further their causes, as did many politicians. With society so corrupt, crime became more prominent as politicians funded crime groups to further their policies.<br><br>
                            This surge in the power of the upper class, led to the mass development of Sydney’s urban center and in a push for urban consolidation much of Sydney’s urban sprawl was demolished, forcing those people into the inner city and freeing up land for industrial construction.<br>
                            These people forced into the city contributed to a much higher poverty rate and worsened crime. At first, Sydney’s police struggled to cope under the growing pressure but they were aided by new technologies and increased militarisation.<br><br>
                            Then, when Donald Trump won the American election he took advantage of Australia’s newfound instability and close relationship to the USA. Most significantly he pressured the Australian government to discriminate against the Asian population.
                            Trump also sent US troops to Australia to enforce his will and establish further US power there, largely due to the tension in the South China Sea. Very soon war broke out, the likes of which the region had never seen. (The conflict there is detailed below.) <br>
                            As a result, many of Sydney’s Asians left the country, fearing for their welfare and lots more moved to Chinatown, which became a refuge for many Asians.<br><br>
                            Now Sydney is a city consumed by it’s own greed, where extreme wealth lies right alongside extreme poverty. Crime and disorder are common as oppression and misfortune plagues many of the city’s residents, overwhelmed by their sudden fall from grace. Corrupt, selfish and indecisive, few politicians or leaders have risen to the challenge and Sydney spirals further down into anarchy.<br><br><br>
                            
                            <h4 class="subtitle">Chinatown</h4>
                            Encompassing a significantly larger area than it did before, Chinatown is a distinct urban village and refuge for Sydney’s Asian population.<br>
                            Chinatown is characterised by relatively poor living conditions and a significant military presence, with the heavily defended US sanctioned Fort Darling located in Tumbalong Park. Commanded by Major Patton the fort exists to secure the area, countering insurgency and repressing both rebels and the general populace.<br>
                            The district is divided between the different groups that live there. The Chinese have the largest territory while the Japanese, Vietnamese and others have smaller territories and there is often tension over territory and resources. Despite this there is a comradery between the residents of Chinatown in the light of their shared misfortune.<br><br>
                            The underground weapon and drug trade is also prominent in Chinatown, with Darling Harbour acting as an important port for smugglers. Other black market goods include exotic medicines, counterfeit currency and even human organs. As a result there are often disputes for control of the harbour by various crime syndicates.<br><br>
                            Despite being unkempt Chinatown is a fairly high-income area as it is situated right next to the CBD and benefits from a high demand for Asian medicine and drugs. The mobsters and business tycoons who run the black market also contribute to the relative prosperity of Chinatown.<br><br>

                            <h4 class="subtitle">South China Sea</h4>
                            Tension in the South China Sea began in 2016, as territorial disputes broke out, sparked by China’s construction of islands in contested maritime territory. Expanding on existing islands or constructing entirely new ones atop atolls by piling up sand, China’s land reclamation efforts marked a significant threat to US and Southeast Asian interests. The other countries who lay claim to regions of the sea: Vietnam, Indonesia, Brunei, the Philippines, Malaysia and Taiwan are all dependent on the South China Sea for the trillions of dollars worth of trade and natural resources present there. Oil and natural gas are abundant and around $5.3 trillion worth of trade passes through the region annually, not to mention the rich fisheries of the area.<br>
                            So with China pursuing a more aggressive claim to territory, tensions escalated, the US quickly becoming involved, working to limit China’s expansion.<br><br>
                            Over 2017 and 2018 the situation quickly became more convoluted; maritime and international laws were unclear, China began stealing sand from other countries to build bases across the South China Sea, Japan sold military ships to Vietnam and the Philippines, and US relations with China worsened due to a range of factors.<br>
                            Additionally, US destroyers were deployed to safeguard trade routes while China built airstrips and placed cruise missiles on its islands. Some fighting broke out as Chinese warships sink Vietnamese fishing boats.<br><br>
                            At the same time Islamic extremist movements were picking up momentum across the region, with the Philippines, Malaysia and Indonesia under significant threat from terrorism. This also contributed to the tension in the South China Sea, with anti-terrorism laws and forces put in place to safeguard the already vulnerable countries. This huge military presence and overwhelming state of fear and uncertainty set the region on edge, primed for war.<br><br>
                            On the 19th of May 2018, that war broke out. A group of Filipino fishermen turned Islamic extremists commandeered a military vessel (some believe with the consent of the government) and shot down a Chinese fighter plane, only to be blown up by a cruise missile from a Malaysian warship that was immediately commandeered by US forces. The spark had been lit. China declared war on the Philippines and the Philippines on China and Malaysia. In months the entire region was at war, a deadly and devastating free-for-all. With government attention focused externally, religious extremism grew unrestrained internally. People were fed up with their situation, many taking to the seas, becoming pirates (not dissimilar from those in Somalia) in order to make a living. In a few shorts months Southeast Asia had been turned upside down. Piracy, poverty and terrorism ran wild, under the backdrop of one of the most devastating wars the world had ever seen.<br><br>
                            Thankfully, within weeks of the war’s outbreak, in an extremely delicate and skilful political manoeuvre, the US proved its worth. Calling a state of emergency (and going rogue from the president and government), leading generals, diplomats and intelligence officers collaborated with the UN to arrange a meeting between the leaders of the countries involved. Miraculously, they achieved their goal, bringing together the stakeholders for a diplomatic meeting. Aware that the conflict was currently unstoppable by diplomacy, the meeting was instead focused on banning nuclear weapons in the war to come, and this goal was achieved, all combatants pledging not to use nuclear arms in the war. The world breathed a sigh of relief but the war went on.<br><br>
                            The Southeast Asian War quickly became predominantely a proxy war between China and the USA, the superpowers using other countries as pawns in their greater conflict; the US only perpetuating the war by their involvement. Alliances have formed and collapsed, with many Southeast Asian countries realising their shared enemy in China. Yet these nations are just as eager to take advantage of the situation in order to claim more territory for themselves so are liable to turn against one another.<br><br>
                            As a close neighbour Australia has very much felt the impact of the Southeast Asian War, with the conflict directly informing the development of Chinatown. Due its close ties to the US, Australia was, like in the Vietnam War, dragged into America’s proxy war.<br>
                            This led to increased militarisation and the establishment of US forces in Australia, as a safe base close to the conflict. With so many troops based in Australia Asians were increasingly segregated, supposedly for monitoring and safety (not unlike the treatment of Germans in WWII). With many young Australian men sent to fight in the war, and many losing their lives, growing distrust and resentment of Asians arose in the Australian population, causing many to turn a blind eye to their poor treatment or even instigate hostility against them.<br><br>
                            All in all, the Southeast Asian War rages on, and with already dire ramifications it shows no signs of coming to a close.<br><br>

                                    <blockquote>"Every great story seems to start with a snake."</blockquote>

                                    When discrimination against Asians began, Nick, then a promising young lawyer, helped his friends Tongyi Shen and Jonathan Pan seek refuge in Chinatown. Here they happened upon a hidden Chinese syndicate, the Longying. Seeking protection and a means to empower themselves they joined their cause and spent years training there and immersing themselves in the syndicate.<br><br>
                                    During this time he lived in an apartment in Chinatown and completed his training as a lawyer, having long had a passion for the profession.
                                    However, as he worked in the business corruption became very evident and Nick was appalled. Coupled with this, due to his race, his work was made very difficult by the government and some of his coworkers, forcing himself to push himself hard to achieve anything.<br><br>
                                    Over this time the Longying became more powerful and conditions across the rest of Sydney worsened. Eventually Nick became so distraught with the state of the legal system he stopped his Longying training to commit to his profession and overcome the obstacles presented by his ethnicity.<br>
                                    While he was away a US raid crippled the Longying and Nick became furious.
                                    With the help of close friends, he put together his arsenal and left to become one of the first vigilantes, Viper.<br><br><br>

                                    Tongyi fled with his friends, Nick and Jonathan, to Chinatown when severe discrimination began. They remained in Chinatown as it was established as an Asian safe zone.
                                    They stumbled upon the Longying and joined the group. While Nick and Jonathan trained, Tongyi took on an administrative role and helped establish connections for the Longying, preferring it to a combat role.<br><br>
                                    He spent years working in restaurants across Chinatown and eventually opened his own restaurant outside of Chinatown. This restaurant was opened in Surry Hills and named the Lucky Moon.<br><br>
                                    Tongyi then proceeded to link his restaurant to the Longying’s tunnel system allowing his restaurant to act as a base of operations and exit from Chinatown. Tongyi has been very careful to remain in the good graces of authorities and takes extra precautions when helping the Longying.<br>
                                    He is a very close friend of Viper and looks out for his vigilante friend. Tongyi often advises and helps ground Viper though they are known to argue.

                                    With the help of his friends Jonathan sought refuge in Chinatown when discrimination against Asians began. Here, he, Nicholas Ramsay and Tongyi Shen met the Longying and joined them.<br>
                                    Jonathan was quick to commit to the group and fully believed in what they were doing. He felt it was his duty as a Chinese-Australian to aid the group’s cause so he trained wholeheartedly for many years. His weapon of choice was the monk’s spade and after learning what he could from the Longying staff master he proceeded to teach himself the finer points of the weapon.<br><br>
                                    He eventually travelled to China to meet a master of the weapon. In China Jonathan trained further and made a reputation for himself, even managing to convince some warriors to return to Sydney with him.<br>
                                    This laid the groundwork for Longying connections to China. When he returned to Sydney Jonathan quickly rose through the ranks of the Longying, gaining a seat on the council of elders despite his youth, and earning his title, Yang Jian, after a Chinese god. Jonathan embraced his title tattooing a third eye onto his forehead, as this ‘truth-seeing eye’ was a feature of the god.<br>
                                    Now Jonathan is one of the best warriors of the Longying and has committed entirely to the group, severing all former ties and fighting with the single mindset of liberating Sydney’s Chinese population.<br><br>

                                    With a name translating to ‘Shadow Dragon’, the Longying are an underground group of traditional Chinese warriors. They seek to liberate the Chinese population of Sydney.<br><br>
                                    Originally the group was small and based in a building near Darling Harbour but US forces discovered them and raided their base, killing many members and destroying important documents and items.
                                    Some Longying survived and moved to Paddy’s Market, which they were able to buy after securing a great sum of money from associates overseas. A secret underground level was built and here the Longying train in ancient weapons and martial arts.<br><br>
                                    They have a system of underground tunnels that link Paddy’s Market to a number of Longying controlled venues across the area, including laundromats and yum-cha restaurants.<br><br>
                                    They now have a strong influence in Chinatown but have escaped government attention, preferring to continue building their forces in secret. They have gained many followers and have some very well trained warriors.<br><br>
                                    Led by a council of elders, they have traditional practices and beliefs, following the teachings of Confucius.

                                    Behind an ornate door guarded by warriors is a staircase leading down to the underground level. This level has many rooms such as training areas, dormitories, armouries and meeting areas.<br>Furthermore, secure doors guarded by warriors allow access to the underground tunnels that lead between bases.

                                            A military helmet developed by DARPA, the BraveHelm is worn by soldiers and influences their brains: reducing stress, keeping focus and reducing pain by using transcranial pulsed ultrasound waves.<br><br>

                                            However, magnetic nanoparticles (surgically implanted and heated by magnetic fields) are also discreetly used in conjunction with the BraveHelm, allowing for near-complete control of a soldier’s actions.<br>
                                            The BraveHelm Alpha controls this, essentially giving the user mind control over soldiers under their command.<br><br>

                                            The BraveHelm is black in colour and has a sliding face guard, allowing protection of the entire head. It is fairly bulky and noticeably geometric in shape. A narrow slit between the faceplate and the head guard allows the soldier to see.<br><br>
                                            The BraveHelm Alpha is similar but has a glowing red alpha symbol roughly above the ears.

                                    <blockquote>"A soldier will fight long and hard for a bit of coloured ribbon."</blockquote>

                                    Lewis grew up hated. Throughout high school the majority of his peers disliked him for his selfish nature, characterised by a desire to improve his own quality of life despite any expense to others. These expenses were sometimes profound and Lewis made far more enemies than he did friends.<br>
                                    During these early years this had little affect on him and he brushed any regrets aside.<br><br>

                                    It was when he left school that reality hit home and in an attempt to escape and, to a minor degree, better himself; he enlisted in the Australian Defence Force. He made this decision following friends from his AFL team, a sport that had played a major part in his youth, as several of teammates also joined the military.<br>
                                    In the Defence Force Lewis’ humour and friendliness made him fast friends and he felt a sense of purpose and acceptance. The discipline of military training brought out the best in Lewis and his old self began to fade away in favour of a new persona, the spitting image of the ANZAC soldier.<br><br>

                                    After training he was deployed to Afghanistan where his newfound skills were put to the test. Lewis soon distinguished himself as a capable soldier and began to climb the ranks.<br>
                                    But then, against his better nature, he became obsessed with ranking up and began to fall back into his manipulative ways in order to do so.<br><br>

                                    <div class="drop-down-box" id="patton">
                                        In the army his best friend was Captain Grove, one of the AFL players Lewis had known during school and so when a rumour began to circulate of Grove’s imminent promotion Lewis was conflicted.
                                        Two days after this, the platoon was split up by a Taliban ambush. Patton and Grove took refuge from the gunfire in a nearby building where they found Corporal Marven, also taking shelter.<br>
                                        While Grove tried to contact backup Patton and Marven stood guard. Peering out at the war-torn street Patton realised a desire to escape the war and remembered Grove’s promotion. In a sudden decision he spun around and gunned down his best friend.<br>
                                        Marven opened fire at Patton and tried to call for backup but was silenced with a shot to the head.<br>
                                        Hearing gunfire quieting outside, Patton quickly hid the bodies and rushed after his retreating platoon. <br><br>

                                        He told his commanding officer that they had been attacked by a large group of Taliban and he had held them off, letting Marven and Grove escape, before turning to flee himself. He claimed he had seen them gunned down, only just managing to escape himself.<br>
                                        Fortunately for Lewis, they were never able to return to that town as the Taliban held it for a long time, letting his lie go by undetected, with Lewis promoted in Grove’s place, for his apparent bravery.<br><br>

                                        Soon he was sent home, with the comfortable rank of Major under his belt. Back in Sydney, with a desire to remain in the military, he found himself promoted to lead the newly established Fort Darling, built to enforce US will in Chinatown and begin the systematic discrimination effort against Asians.<br><br>

                                        Known in the army as a trusted and capable soldier he was also selected to trial the recently developed BraveHelms and with funding from the US Army, Fort Darling was soon stocked with a vast armoury, all of it under Patton’s command.<br>
                                        Finally granted with the power and comfort he’d sought, Patton was contempt and was happy to do whatever was asked of him in order to hold onto his position.<br><br>

                                        He was comfortable but for one thing. Alone at night memories of his actions come back to torment him and he is consumed by self-loathing and insecurity. Grove’s death in particular, deeply troubles Patton.<br>
                                        In the day though, Major Patton forces his insecurity aside and become the cool, calm and collected leader of Fort Darling.

                                            A military helmet developed by DARPA, the BraveHelm is worn by soldiers and influences their brains: reducing stress, keeping focus and reducing pain by using transcranial pulsed ultrasound waves.<br><br>

                                            However, magnetic nanoparticles (surgically implanted and heated by magnetic fields) are also discreetly used in conjunction with the BraveHelm, allowing for near-complete control of a soldier’s actions.<br>
                                            The BraveHelm Alpha controls this, essentially giving the user mind control over soldiers under their command.<br><br>

                                            The BraveHelm is black in colour and has a sliding face guard, allowing protection of the entire head. It is fairly bulky and noticeably geometric in shape. A narrow slit between the faceplate and the head guard allows the soldier to see.<br><br>
                                            The BraveHelm Alpha is similar but has a glowing red alpha symbol roughly above the ears.

                                    <blockquote>"A fanatic is one who sticks to his guns whether they're loaded or not."</blockquote>

                                    When the Southeast Asian War broke out and the discrimination of Sydney’s Asian population began John Tian was pressured to leave his job as a doctor in the Royal Woman’s Hospital and move to Chinatown, setting up a small clinic as a low-paid GP. Fortunately he had substantial wealth to fall back on, thanks to inheritance, his doctoring job and winnings from his career as a competitive swordsman.<br>
                                    In Chinatown the Longying soon contacted him and Tian became a passionate and popular member. Soon however, Fort Darling was established and Patton’s reign of terror began. Tian was infuriated by his oppression, a fury only intensified when brawling soldiers accidentally killed his beloved sister. Determined to cleanse the streets of his white oppressors Tian became noticeably more brutal in his vigilantism and began to be influenced by the propaganda coming out of warring China, inspiring in him an irrational hatred of whites.<br>
                                    Yet John was smart enough to keep these sympathies hidden, using his skill and charm to work his way up the ranks in the Longying, becoming hugely popular and influential. He was rewarded with the title of Guan Yu, a famous Chinese god, and he embraced the associated leadership role, essentially taking over the Longying. In this position John Tian relentlessly hunts down the enemies of his people as the Blood Faced Swordsman.<br><br>

                                    <blockquote>"I have never yet heard of a murderer who was not afraid of a ghost."</blockquote>

                                    Hugo had dreamed of being a superhero since his childhood so when he saw an infomercial promising ‘amazing physical abilities' he leapt at the chance, signing up despite warnings from his friends and family. This rash decision was also influenced by recent bouts of depression, causing him to question his self-worth and seek ways to better it. <br><br>

                                    He was accepted and sent to a facility owned by the corporation, ExoCorp. Here he underwent tests and minor experiments for a while with no success. Hugo was disappointed and deemed the endeavour hopeless, deciding to stop attending his sessions. After not turning up for several appointments some of the Velvet Knights arrived at his home. Hugo, finally feeling wanted, was convinced to return to ExoCorp. So he followed the Knights outside where they forcibly detained Hugo and returned him to ExoCorp where his captors claimed he was too important to be allowed to leave.<br><br>

                                    Hugo was angry with himself for being tricked and resolved to be uncooperative with the scientists. As a result they drugged him and the rest of his time in the facility passed as a blur.<br>
                                    Eventually Hugo awoke in a room, alone but for Phillip Dean, the owner of ExoCorp, and as he came to was shocked to discover he had no physical form. He was startled but elated, figuring it was his promised ability. That was until he was told that so far the process had been irreversible at which point he flipped and tried and tried to get away. For some reason he was unable to escape and Dean eventually managed to calm him down, explaining that they believed the trigger was a mental process. Hugo concentrated hard and managed to revert to a tangible state.<br><br>
                                    <div class="drop-down-box" id="spectre">
                                        Dean then began to tell Hugo how amazing this power was and how beneficial it could be.<br>
                                        He learnt that the Dean’s plan was to keep him captive, in order to test more, ensuring it was viable, then distribute the technology globally with the goal of bettering society.
                                        Despite his apparent goodwill Hugo was disagreeable, not wanting to be tricked again or have his power lost in further experimentation so when a commotion erupted in another ward he seized the opportunity to escape, this time succeeding.<br>
                                        After successfully escaping he decided that it would be best to keep what had happened secret, so that people don’t know about the technology and don’t flock to the corporation wanting superpowers of their own.<br>
                                        Hugo also decided that he might as well become the superhero he had wanted to be so he snuck back into ExoCorp and stole the suit designed for him.<br>
                                        With this he became the Silver Spectre and began his campaign to stop the work of ExoCorp.

                                    ExoCorp is an Australian based science corporation specialising in bioengineering and particle physics. The corporation works with international companies to develop technologies for global benefit.
                                    Led by the enigmatic genius Philip Dean, the company has made many technological breakthroughs.
                                    ExoCorp performs many of its studies behind closed doors and has little public profile despite being recognised for many technologies.
                                    In addition, ExoCorp has very tight security. Dean funds the upkeep of a group of special operatives, agents known as the Velvet Knight who are responsible for containing and protecting assets.
                                    ExoCorp was responsible for the P-3 experiments, which gave rise to the Experimentals and began a new and more sinister period for the company, with security increased exponentially and the Velvet Knights deployed to recapture the Experimentals.

                                    Throughout his adolescence Dylan had a deep interest in biotechnology so upon graduating high school he pursued this and his innovative ideas and outstanding results quickly gained him recognition. With this came a high position working for the corporation ExoCorp.

                                    Here he assisted the work of Philip Dean, helping the company with many of their inventions and the company made great technological developments.
                                    In his personal life, however, he took up wrestling to relieve some of the stress of his work and personal life, characterized by unsuccessful relationships.
                                    One such relationship was that with Daniel Watson, an intern who Dylan immediately disliked and made life difficult for, eventually having him fired.
                                    Dylan found a way to take out this frustration, fighting in the wrestling ring and he gradually became more invested, particularly in the infamous Wrestling Society. Here he adopted the alias of the Red Rhino and was fairly successful in his fights, unleashing his discontent in the underground fights.

                                    Then Daniel Watson, with a loan from his wealthy father, took over the Wrestling Society, largely to get back at Dylan. Twisted and now powerful, Daniel forced Dylan to begin work on a series of performance-enhancing drugs, to up the stakes of the fights.
                                    Unable to act otherwise, Dylan began using the ExoCorp facilities to work on these drugs: known as the AB3 Series.
                                    <div class="drop-down-box" id="rhino">
                                        They became immensely potent over the course of their development, often with crippling side effects, but Dylan managed to perfect one, naming it Substax. This drug caused exponential growth in the user and toughened their skin but had the side effects of causing the user’s veins to glow red while in use and leading to irritation and mood swings.

                                        Dylan began using Substax in the wrestling ring for Daniel had been growing violently impatient. However, back at ExoCorp his superiors noticed his strange behaviour and discovered the AB3 drugs. Dean was furious and immediately fired Dylan.
                                        Dylan was distraught and rapidly became destitute, blowing his money on alcohol and falling back on wrestling to earn money. Fortunately, he had a vast supply of Substax at his home, which helped fuel his wrestling and a growing dependence on the drug.

                                        It was at this point that the Silver Spectre came into his life, having heard of Dylan from Sergeant Jonah Riley. Having found it unable to achieve anything on his own, and keen to form a team, Hugo was able to convince Dylan to join him and take a stand against ExoCorp.
                                        Hugo helped Dylan regain his reputation and they became very close friends quickly as they began working together against ExoCorp.
                                        It also soon became clear that Dean had taken the AB3 drugs for his own purposes and Dylan resolved to reclaim them, fearing what Dean might achieve with his creations.

                                    <blockquote>"Science never solves a problem without creating ten more."</blockquote>

                                    Philip was raised by his father after his mother died of cancer. He became very introverted and during school devoted himself to his studies. He excelled academically and eventually founded a company of his own.

                                    This company, ExoCorp, was a scientific organisation focused on bioengineering with the aim of helping humanity, in part a personal reconciliation for his mother’s death.
                                    ExoCorp became very successful, pioneering a range of technologies as one of the leaders in the scientific community. With this Philip gained worldwide recognition.

                                    Dean’s influence grew with ExoCorp’s and he hired the Velvet Knights to maintain the company’s security, paranoid that an accident would compromise his work, and figuring they could also help support the police force.

                                    Gradually however, ExoCorp’s methods became much more sinister as Dean began to reason that the limitations the law and ethics placed on science only inhibited the progress and ultimately, the good, he was sure he was capable of.
                                    So Dean, assuring himself that he was doing something future generations would thank him for began a new, confidential and unrestricted department of the company, tossing aside most legal and ethical boundaries to push the limits of science.

                                    Then, in perhaps his most significant breakthrough, Philip began experimenting with applying particle physics to biotechnology and secretly began the P-2 experiments, which led to the creation of Experimentals like Silver Spectre.
                                    But then the Experimentals escaped.<br><br><br>

                                    The Velvet Knights are an elite force of hitmen-for-hire, offering their services to the side of wealth over that of morality. As a 0result the group has become notorious amongst the criminal underworld for their brutal yet effective techniques in carrying out the requests of their employers. Formed in the UK, the group has since increased in size and scale and has established a solid presence in Australia, abandoning their country of origin. Recently, they have grown a reputation in Sydney under the employment of Philip Dean and ExoCorp.<br><br><br>

                                    <h4 class="subtitle">History</h4>
                                    Following the Kray Brother’s brief arrest and release in January of 1965, criminal gangs in London became fearful of heightened police caution towards their illegal activities. It was due to this that the Richardson and Kray Twins gangs became eager to form some sort of discreet alliance that would allow them to continue their activities without the crimes being traced back to either faction.<br>
                                    This alliance came in the form of a new group known as the Velvet Knights, which both gangs controlled.<br><br>
                                    The Knights consisted of the collaborating gangs best men who went by the codenames of the Knights of the Round Table in order to remain as discreet as possible. Of these men, the most notable was Felix Haycock, the first Arthur of the Knights, along with Alastair Hughes who was selected for his brutal boxing skills and tough physique (despite being as young as 17 at the time).<br><br>

                                    The main use for this newly formed group was to carry out the more dangerous jobs tasked to the gangs. This ensured no trace of any severe crime could be linked to either main gang. It was thanks to this partnership that both gangs were able to evade police suspicion for some time as they were focused on catching this mysterious new ‘blood-suits gang.’ The Knights proved to be more efficient than originally intended, with no member ever apprehended or killed.<br><br>

                                    All ran smoothly throughout 1965. The Richardson and Kray Brothers gangs were able to continue their own operations while the Velvet Knights bore the load of the riskier work. However, this came to an end in late December of the same year after a fight broke out between multiple members of either gang during a Christmas party at the Astor Club. This sparked a long and intense turf war between both gangs, destroying their prior alliance and leaving the Velvet Knights without leadership or control. Due to this the Knights were free to distance themselves from either gang and took out on their own, looking for employment elsewhere.<br><br>

                                    Throughout the 20th century the Velvet Knights fell under the leadership of multiple gangs, corporations and political figures within Europe, carrying out their dirty work with the utmost efficiency and style. More often than not, the only reason for the Knights to ever switch their allegiance to another employer was either when a greater price was offered or if their current hirer was killed (usually the knights would off their bosses if pay became unreliable).<br><br>
                                    The group became adaptive with their business, quickly replacing lost members and building their own reputation, with their signature red suits and haunting methods striking fear into any target they were set upon.<br>
                                    By the beginning of the 21st century the Knights were still going strong, but the only remaining one of the original knights was Alastair Hughes, who had progressed to Arthur and felt a deep connection to the group of which his life had revolved around for the last 36 years.<br><br>

                                    In 2004 the Velvet Knights opted to migrate to Sydney, Australia, in an effort to establish a presence in a new and promising market.<br>
                                    This decision proved astute as it was within the same year that they were profitably employed by Philip Dean on behalf of ExoCorp. Despite the knights not being totally on board with Dean’s methods, the pay and technological benefits massively outweighed any negatives.<br>
                                    Now the Velvet Knights work as ExoCorp’s private security force and elite operative team, primarily tasked with containing the escaped Experimentals.<br>

                                    <blockquote>"Ambition should be made of sterner stuff."</blockquote>

                                    Born with an intellectual disability into a very wealthy family, Daniel lived an extremely privileged life from the start. His father was a successful financial consultant and Daniel grew up with everything he desired, becoming accustomed to getting his way.<br><br>

                                    As a result it was challenging for Daniel to adjust to the high school setting. He was quickly targeted for his eccentricities and was suddenly faced with people who did not bend to his will. Daniel was also disliked at school due to his political beliefs, which were notably right wing.<br>
                                    Daniel leeched off his parents’ affluence to survive adolescence and it was only with subtle coercing that his mother and father persuaded Daniel to find work as a young adult. His father, now on a contract with upcoming company ExoCorp, secured an internship there for his son.<br><br>

                                    At ExoCorp, Daniel was assigned to work with leading bioengineer, Dylan Jenkin, but Jenkin immediately despised his outspoken and arrogant intern and had him dismissed.<br>
                                    However in the time that they had been together Daniel learnt of a group called the Wrestling Society, which Jenkin frequented.<br>
                                    Seeing a way to get back at Dylan Daniel got a sizeable sum of money from his relatively submissive parents and bought the Wrestling Society. Daniel had the former owners discreetly killed and the society’s home building revamped.<br>

                                    Growing in power, Daniel forced his father to work as a consultant for his new business and together they brought a heavy gambling aspect into the Society, enabling them to turn a large profit.<br>
                                    Now Daniel reigns gleefully over the Wrestling Society as its ‘director.’ He has almost complete control over everyone involved with the Society. He is greatly aided by his wealth to fund his project.<br>
                                    Daniel also has an interest in new technologies, especially those developed by ExoCorp and it was from here that he had his trademark fists stolen, dubbing himself Gilgamesh, after the demigod.<br><br><br>

                                    The Sydney Guard was Sydney’s first vigilante team. The group is based in North Sydney, specifically around Mosman and Cammeray. The group’s main goal is to combat ExoCorp and Philip Dean, preventing their technological and criminal enterprises.<br><br>

                                    The group maintains a very low public profile and is limited by a lack of money and influence. Combined with personal factors, this means the Sydney Guard are confined to the shadows, waging their war of attrition against North Sydney’s criminal underworld.<br>

                                    <h4 class="subtitle">History</h4>
                                    After becoming the Silver Spectre, Hugo Johannsen was immediately out of his depth, struggling to single-handedly bring down ExoCorp and evade capture by the Velvet Knights.<br>
                                    Eventually he decided to approach his old friend Jonah Riley for assistance. Now a capable policeman he was eventually persuaded to help the Silver Spectre.<br>
                                    Riley also provided Hugo with a serious of police reports related to an individual titled the Red Rhino who had been causing trouble. Jonah suggested Hugo might be able to apprehend him where police had failed.<br><br>
                                    Hugo was reluctant but decided to see what could be done and eventually managed to locate Dylan Jenkins, the man behind the Red Rhino.<br> Realising the gravity of Dylan’s situation, Hugo set out to help him and was successful, securing Dylan’s help in the fight against ExoCorp, with the two  becoming very close friends.<br><br>
                                    Soon after, Jonah realised his close friend Mockingbird would be a beneficial member to the growing team and he suggested she seek out Hugo and Dylan. Siena was readily taken in by Spectre after discrediting Dylan’s suspicions.<br><br>

                                    Inspired by his love for superheroes, Hugo declared the group the Sydney Guard and together the newly formed group began their campaign for Sydney.

                                    <h4 class="subtitle">Base</h4>
                                    Reformed, the Red Rhino was approached by Slimy Simon, accountant and general errand boy for the Wrestling Society.<br> Acting under Gilgamesh, Simon pressured Dylan to return to the wrestling ring. Dylan saw an opportunity and a responsibility and returned to the Wrestling Society.<br>
                                    Then sitting at rank 6, Dylan climbed up to rank 2 and negotiated with the ruler of the Society, Daniel Watson, making a deal for his purchase of a disused part of Watson’s complex, (located on Military Road in Neutral Bay).<br><br>
                                    Dylan made some minor renovations to the space, enhancing it as a base of operations for the Sydney Guard.<br>
                                    Inside there is a small wrestling ring surrounded by a number of seats, along with a locker room and a small private conference room. A tiny safe-room, used to hold gambling money during fights is also present.<br>
                                    As such, the space serves as an ideal base for the Guard and provides a source of income, with Dylan teaching wrestling/self-defence lessons for civilians.

                                    <blockquote>"The only thing we have to fear is fear itself."</blockquote>

                                After graduating university Siena struggled to find work any work as an artist so she was relieved when her old friend Jonah Riley managed to find her a position in the NSW Police as a forensic artist. While initially a precarious position Siena’s good work and aptitude for her job made her a valued member of the North Sydney police force.<br><br>
                                Soon after she joined the force a serial killer began a reign of terror across North Sydney. Leaving a trail of disfigured corpses in his wake the killer continually eluded police and quickly gained infamy as the ‘Sydney Slasher’. Alongside Sergeant Jonah Riley, Siena worked tirelessly to try and bring the killer to justice gradually adding to a composite drawing of the killer based on various victim and witness reports. Constructing this portrait took a heavy toll on Siena’s mental health. This recurring struggle to develop a reconstruction of the Slasher, averaging many disparate portraits and creating a shadowy, half-human image left a deep imprint in her troubled mind as in her sleep-deprived and hyper-stressed state the unfinished image of the Slasher was the one consistent feature.<br>
                                As the investigation progressed Siena and Jonah began to realise their commanding officer, Superintendent Wade was working to hinder their efforts on behalf of the government and wealthy developers. With the killings taking place in the high-income neighbourhoods of harbourside North Sydney, an area highly sought after by the investors who had redeveloped the now science district to the north, the killings provided an unpleasant but beneficial way to lower the value of the neighbourhood, allowing residents to be pushed out and developers to move in. Appalled, Siena convinced Jonah to strike out on their own. As rogue agents, they adopted call signs to maintain anonymity across their radio channels. Jonah dubbed himself Romeo and Siena Echo 59: Echo in reference to her interest in the police’s sonic weapons and 59 as the call code for ‘criminal mischief.’<br><br>

                                    <div class="drop-down-box" id="siena">
                                        Over this time Siena became increasingly paranoid and emotionally affected by the horrors she was dealing with daily and as she developed closer bonds with people personally affected by the killings she was determined to do whatever it took to stop the killer.<br>
                                        When the sixth victim was killed Siena and Jonah learnt that there had been another murder in that same house many years before. Suspecting a correlation, Siena dug deeper and met with Mrs Weingarten, the wife of the man killed. Though Mrs Weingarten suffered from mild dementia, Siena and Jonah were able to learn of the family’s history and pinpointed her son Michael as a prime suspect, a family photo also linking him to Siena’s drawing. Siena realised from Mrs Weingarten’s stories that each of the Slasher’s murders had taken place at a location significant to the boy. Realising this pattern they figured that the next killing would take place at the next most significant landmark in Michael’s life, the boarding school he had been sent to after killing his father.<br>
                                        The boarding school, now abandoned due to abuse of the children by the staff, was a huge run down complex in the outskirts of North Sydney. Arriving at Jonah’s early the next night, Siena found him passed out drunk. Furious, she left a note and went to confront the Sydney Slasher on her own, where staking out the boarding school, Siena was ambushed and captured by Michael.<br>
                                        Held captive, Siena was forced to endure the Slasher’s torture, as he began to carve a smiley face into her shoulder. Suddenly, Jonah, still hopelessly drunk stumbled into the room and shot at Michael, missing by a yard and collapsing in a heap. Aggravated, the Slasher, having carved half a smiley face into Siena’s skin, stabbed the knife into her shoulder for safekeeping and went to deal with Riley. Mitchell, grabbing the blade with her teeth, dropped it into her hand and managed to release herself, rushing upstairs in a desperate bid to escape. Suddenly she came to the realisation that she had left Jonah behind and accepting responsibility, she decides to overcome her fear and turned back for Michael.<br>
                                        She hears him hunting her through the corridors and spots him through a crack, seeing that he has Jonah’s gun. Clearly at a severe disadvantage, she stalked him before tackling him and grappling for the gun, shooting Michael in the waist in the process, while he managed to bite into her leg. Both severely injured they clawed their way through the building, reaching the rooftop. Here they again grappled, bloody and weak. Fuelled by the memories of his victims and how he had damaged her, Siena decided Weingarten had to die and, holding him close, rolled off the edge of the building, just as a dreary Jonah arrived. As she fell, Mitchell, close to the wall, struck a small balcony, tossing Michael from her grip and catching her fall as the Sydney Slasher plummeted into the depths of the abandoned building.<br><br>
                                        Eventually Siena returned to the police force where she continues to work as a forensic artist while training to be forensic scientist. However still shaken by her experiences with the Sydney Slasher and concerned by the corruption she discovered, Siena continues to use the identity of Echo 59 to fight crime in the streets of Sydney and ensure there is never another Slasher.<br>
                                        Soon after, Sergeant Riley told her about the Silver Spectre and the growing Sydney Guard and recommended Siena join. She quickly did.<br><br>

                                    Jonah joined the NSW Police Force after leaving school and gradually worked his way up to the rank of sergeant thanks to his skills and generally good conduct, positively influenced by his newfound responsibility. However he eventually became more complacent and reverted to his teenage nature: footloose, deviant and self-destructive.<br><br>
                                    Nonetheless, at the same time he reached out to his struggling friend Siena Mitchell, securing her a job with the police as a forensic artist. Together they worked to bring down the Sydney Slasher and fight corruption in the police force.<br>
                                    Though he didn’t let it on, the investigation into the Sydney Slasher took a heavy emotional toll on Riley, such that, in terror, he drank himself into oblivion prior to their final confrontation with the Slasher, unable to face his fears. Guilty at having abandoned Siena he drunkenly managed to bring himself to her aid, helping save her from Weingarten’s clutches and bearing witness to her self-sacrifice. Witnessing her attempted suicide gave Riley a profound respect for his friend and made clear his obligation to protect her.<br><br>
                                    Jonah was then approached by his old friend Hugo Johannsen (now the Silver Spectre) for help in his campaign against ExoCorp. After some threatening, Jonah reluctantly agreed to help, and now helps keep the police off Hugo’s back.<br>
                                    Riley also pointed Hugo in the direction of the Red Rhino, which led to his integration into the Sydney Guard. Eventually Jonah also suggested Siena for the group and thanks to their friendship became more involved in helping the Sydney Guard.<br><br>
                                    Jonah is a talented police sergeant working on a wide range of delicate cases but thanks to his difficult nature he has made many enemies within the force and lives a dangerous and tumultuous life.

                                    <blockquote>"Death is not the worst that can happen to men."</blockquote>

                                    At the age of 6 Michael accidentally shot his pet dog, Marlowe with a BB-gun. This sparked something inside him and the young boy began down a darker path, developing a perverted and sadistic interest in horror and violence. He became a fan of horror films and metal bands like Metallica, contributing to an increasingly dysfunctional personality.<br>
                                    When he was 8 years old the family’s car was stolen, a prized heirloom, his father, to whom the vehicle held great significance, began to act strangely. He became angry with his wife and son, turning to alcohol to escape the consequences of these actions.<br>
                                    His father’s degeneration came to a climax one day when Michael’s father attacked his mother. Michael had formed a tight and complex relationship with his mother so grabbing a knife from the kitchen; he attacked his father, stabbing the man fifty times before his mother calmed him down.<br>
                                    The family never fully recovered from the incident. Michael went through a series of counselling, support and welfare programs while his mother was forced to take multiple jobs to provide for them.<br><br>
                                    When he finally finished school, Michael travelled to Israel, having been there previously and enticed by his family history in the region. When he was there he was exposed to violent crime and terrorist groups and was, in a sense, inspired by their actions.<br>
                                    However, Michael didn’t have the religious faith sought after by these groups and even they were for the most part disturbed by his peculiarities. Unable to find acceptance, he returned to Sydney.<br><br>
                                    In Sydney he got a job in a video store but after a few months his manager, Guy, fired him, discovering Whenigah had stolen a number of films from the shop. Michael left calmly and promised to return the films the next day.<br>
                                    When he returned he lured Guy to an alley at the back of the shop where he tore out his throat with a fork and then ‘experimented’ with the body, disfiguring it beyond recognition.<br>
                                    Similarly to the BB-gun incident, killing Guy awoke something in Michael. It was without shock or amazement that he realised he had a genuine addiction to death, a love of the application of pain and torment.<br>
                                    Sickening as it is, Whenigah had become enamoured with his fantasies of hate, pain, grief, gore and horror, the seeds of which were planted in his childhood.<br><br>
                                    And so began the rampage of the Sydney Slasher, as Michael Whenigah embarked on a killing spree that shook Sydney to its foundations. After killing 6 victims he was finally found by police after a frantic search while his infamy spread.<br>
                                    Specifically, it was forensic artist, Siena Mitchell, who finally found Whenigah, or rather he captured her. Unfortunately for him, she was able to escape and in a final confrontation atop his warehouse home, she pushed him off the roof of the building.<br><br><br>

Notably, by embracing these desires a twisted freedom is achieved, Michael liberated from the constraints of morality.</li>
                                                <li>Ideas of judgement are also toyed with, where questions must be asked about his history to determine whether he is truly just an evil monster or instead an unlucky kid, defined by his trauma and set on his path since the age of six.</li>
                                                <li>These moral and philosophical dilemmas make the Slasher a thought-provoking character and add to his horror, entertaining the thought that there is a person, some humanity, behind his appalling façade.</li>

                                    <blockquote>"The only thing that can kill a tiger is another tiger."</blockquote>

                                    As a high school student Kyle had extremely sweaty palms, a fact which he was very annoyed by. He began working to treat his strange condition with the use of an iontophoresis machine, which uses a localised electric current to limit excessive sweating. Kyle used the contraption frequently but during this time the machine broke and when he next used it, the charge was exceptionally strong, enough to stun Kyle and severely burn his hands.<br>
                                    He was rushed to hospital where doctors were able to treat his burns but at the cost of all feeling in his hands. The receptors in his skin had been destroyed by the electricity. Kyle returned to his normal life and was thankful he had survived more or less intact.<br>
                                    Also throughout high school, and for a period afterwards, Kyle trained extensively in martial arts at a local gym. Here he became highly skilled in taekwondo and kickboxing and was granted a job teaching there.<br><br>
                                    Then Kyle’s father died. The family was shocked and Kyle was devastated. He decided to travel to India in order to reconnect with his roots and get away from his life in Sydney. He planned to arrive in Kolkata and meet his family there, before heading north to climb in the Himalayas.<br>
                                    But as soon as Kyle arrived in Kolkata it was clear he wasn’t going to find peace there. It was a city consumed by itself, sweltering under an oppressive tropical climate and awash with squalor and rank with poverty, pollution and raw noise.<br>
                                    Nonetheless it was here that Kyle would remain, as it became increasingly difficult to leave. His family, composed of a mass of cousins, aunts and uncles, demanded his attention. Meanwhile some of his cousins slyly lured him into the world of Kolkata’s gangs. Kyle was ashamed of himself for working with the gang (named the ‘Tigers’) but continued regardless, reasoning that he wanted to experience the brutality and not hide from the reality of his family's world. He was aided by his martial arts skills which were further refined during this time as he added the traditional Indian weapons of bagh naka and later chakram to his arsenal.<br>

                                    <div class="drop-down-box" id="kyle">

                                        Most of his work in the Tigers was around petty rivalries and robberies but occasionally they got bigger jobs selling opium. Still, Kyle remained adamant that he needed to experience this world, a world his father had come from and remained a great man.<br><br>

                                        It was during this time that Kyle met a girl and fell in love. Asri Nanda was the daughter of a friend of Kyle’s uncle, Raj Rampal, and the two met at a family gathering.<br>
                                        Little did Kyle know that the gathering was actually just a chance for Asri’s father and Raj to discuss the marriage of Asri to Kyle’s cousin Eshan, the leader of the Tigers, an arrangement which would be beneficial to the two men.<br>
                                        Unknowingly, Kyle courted Asri and for the first time since his father's death he was actually happy. Elated, Kyle began to plan his escape from Kolkata and new life with Asri.<br>
                                        When the marriage between Eshan and Asri was announced Kyle broke. It was set to happen imminently and his family demanded his help for the wedding preparations. Aghast, Kyle ignored them and took to the streets of Kolkata, where he wandered for days, lost in self-pity.<br><br>
                                        On the fifth day, Kyle found himself in a patch of jungle on the outskirts of the city and he lay against a tree to rest. He woke to see a procession of elephants silently marching between the trees.<br>
                                        It’s hard to say exactly what happened next. The superstitious would note the auspicious number five and take the elephants as a spiritual omen, perhaps the mark of the gods, but Kyle was changed by this experience regardless. He was reinvigorated with a new sense of determination. His love for Asri was intense and he felt a deep hatred for the arranged marriage and Eshan the gang lord. Kyle was fed up with his lot in life and the whole of his experience in Kolkata. In him a new sense of purpose and conviction was sparked.<br><br>
                                        Kyle turned back towards home and caught a taxi, arriving at the end of the wedding celebrations. He lurked at the rear of the house until the last partygoers had left.<br>
                                        Then, taking up his bagh naka he scaled the side of the building to the newlywed’s nuptial chamber. Steeling himself he leapt into the room and furiously descended on Eshan, tearing into him with the cruel iron talons of his bagh naka. Seeing his cousin's mutilated body before him as his anger descended from its climax the gravity of his actions hit Kyle. He trembled with grief as he turned to Asri, who was frozen in fear.<br>
                                        Hopelessly he pleaded for her to leave with him and desperately proclaimed his feelings for her. Instead, she was mortified and attacked Kyle who tried meekly to defend himself. All the while Asri shouted that he had destroyed the sanctity of their marriage and killed her one true love. Tears pourd down her face as sh screamed that her duty to her family superseded all, that their relationship didn't have divine approval.<br>
                                        Kyle was stunned and devastated by her sudden change and once again fled into the depths of Kolkata, where in a lonely alley he told his story to an old man. The old man listened intently and afterwards they sat together in silence for a while until the old man offered his opinion.<br>
                                        "You’re a fraud friend. You’re not one of us. You don’t understand this city or these people. I’m sorry but this isn’t your fight. It’s time you went home."<br>
                                        And so, heartbroken, exploited and ashamed Kyle returned home to Sydney.<br><br>
                                        Finally home, Kyle was quick to settle back in, finding a job as a martial arts teacher at Annandale North Public School. He wasn’t an average teacher to say the least, his qualities directly conflicting those suited to the profession. Still, he made his impact on the student body and found a satisfaction in the work, becoming a de-facto counsellor for many students.<br>
                                        Still reeling from his experience in India, Kyle was inspired by talk of Chinatown’s Viper and realised that Sydney was a place he did understand and a place he could do something for. This, along with a sense of duty brought on by his students, led to the beginnings of an idea in his head.
                                        Around the streets word spread of men left with grievous wounds, screaming in pain, skin flayed and with only cries of the burning agony inflicted on them by the one who came quickly to be known as Burning Hand.<br>
                                        Kyle’s fight for Sydney had begun.<br>

                                    <blockquote>"Hope is but the dream of those who wake."</blockquote>

                                    All throughout his life Dexter has dreamed of success. With big ideas and a big heart he was determined and expecting to see his dreams through. So when his exams fell through and the university system denied him (now extremely exclusive and expensive) he was thrown into the deep end, having to find new ways to provide for his family, who had exhausted most of their money on school and tutoring fees.<br>
                                    Struggling financially, Dexter found work as a bus driver and began to earn a meagre income. While he was learning the ropes however, his mother was stricken with a deadly disease brought in by an illegal immigrant whom she had crossed paths with.<br>
                                    Dexter and his father tried to earn the money needed to treat her and appealed to the government for help. They were unsuccessful and Dexter’s mother passed away.<br>
                                    In testament to his character, Dexter did not blindly blame the immigrant, remaining a steadfast advocate for accepting asylum seekers. With resilience he persevered and went back to work to provide for his grieving father.<br>
                                    Along with working as a bus driver, Dexter volunteers in a soup kitchen on the weekends, providing food to the homeless.<br>
                                    Dexter lives his life with the firm belief that one-day he’ll be somewhere else, finally following his dreams.<br><br><br>

                                    It came as no surprise to anyone who knew him when Liam was, at the tender age of 17, apprehended by the police and sent to a juvenile detention centre. This came as a result of a wide array of drug-related offences and illegal activities.<br>
                                    This came about partly due to a highly challenging upbringing, in which Liam and his younger brother Zack were forced to grow up in a dysfunctional and sometimes dangerous family environment with an alcoholic father and without a mother. This family unit was further disconnected as Liam’s father was forced to spend prolonged periods of time away managing his farm in the country. As a result Liam grew up largely without parental guidance and turned to narcotics as a solution.<br><br>
                                    Inside the juveline detention centre this history was eventually recognised despite Liam’s reluctance to provide information and the caretakers tried to encourage him on a healthier path.<br>
                                    About halfway into his time there a deal was struck, cutting Liam’s jail sentence in half in return for Liam’s help infiltrating one of Sydney’s gangs, a group of bikies called the Comancheros. With gangs on the rise, fuelled by politicians and a spike in crime, the NSWPF were desperate to try to contain the gangs and a similar infiltration tactic had been employed in New Zealand to good effect.<br>
                                    Liam readily accepted and was soon back on the streets.<br><br>

                                    <div class="drop-down-box" id="crespo">
                                        For months he ignored his agreement with the police and took a job as a labourer to earn some money. Taking note of his lack of cooperation the police sent Sergeant Riley to remind him of their agreement. Liam tried to shrug off Riley but eventually agreed to do what was asked of him.<br>
                                        Some days later he showed up at a Comanchero clubhouse, where after a half-hearted attempt to infiltrate the gang he stole a motorcycle and fled into the countryside, making a beeline for his family farm.<br>
                                        For some months he hid from the police and bikies at the large cattle station managed by his father, taking pleasure in the farm work and practicing with his stolen motorcycle in his free time. For the most part he and his father got on well, by avoiding each other.<br><br>
                                        One day however, news reached the Crespos that Liam’s younger brother Zack had been taken hostage by the Comanchero, in retaliation for Liam stealing what was apparently one of their most prized motorcycles.<br>
                                        Liam’s father was furious, outraged at Liam’s supposed failure and weakness, and after a furious row Liam took his father’s shotgun and left back to Sydney with the intent to prove himself and save his brother.<br><br>
                                        He arrived back in Sydney at night and under cover of darkness pulled up to the Comanchero Club. He stormed into the strangely vacant club and launched an assault its occupants.<br>
                                        After some ‘persuasion’ Liam was told that Zack was being held in another Comanchero Club in Parramatta. Liam arrived to find the place ransacked and delving deeper into the building he came upon his brother, slowly dying from two bullet wounds in his chest.<br><br>
                                        Liam had grown up very close to his brother and had always felt responsible for him. But recently Liam had become distant and sharing this last moment with his brother Liam regretted the path he had chosen.<br>
                                        But this regret was corrupted by a burst of anger. Liam was unwilling to lay all the blame on himself and set his sights on the people behind his brother's murder.<br><br>
                                        Zack passed away in his arms and after laying his brother to rest Liam began his crusade against the Comanchero.<br>
                                        Leaving the club he found himself in a bar. After a few drinks the barman asked for his name, to which, after some thought, Liam decided on Adam. This marked a significant turning point for Liam. It was a metamorphosis of sorts, a transformation from one man into another, offering him a chance at a new life and a new identity. The first man seemed a fitting place to start and God knew he was prone to sin.<br><br>
                                        On his private crusade Liam soon learnt that Zach’s death had actually come at the hands of the sworn enemies of the Comanchero, a rival bikie gang known as the Bandidos, who had raided the Comanchero club and killed Zack.<br>
                                        Now Liam had a fight on two fronts and he played the field adeptly, waging a war on both the bikie gangs that had wronged him. He built a reputation for himself as a merciless one-man army.<br><br>
                                        His relentless assault fractured the gangs, turning them further against each other and themselves, culminating in a huge battle in Jubilee Park, where Liam, with help from the Burning Hand, came out on top of the assembled gangs. In the Jubilee Park Showdown Crespo proudly killed Comanchero leader Mick Murray.<br>
                                        Following directions he discovered a Comanchero safe house, a bunker-like building, filled to the brim with weapons and narcotics. Commandeering the building, Liam went back to drug dealing and with the help of some online tutorials he put together an arsenal of cannabis bombs to aid him.<br>
                                        And aid him they would because Liam’s fight was far from over. The Bandidos remained, but more than that Liam had begun to feel a sense of duty, a desire to continue fighting in his brother’s name. This desire would push him to become one of Sydney’s most feared and relentless vigilantes; Adam Crespo.<br>

                                    <blockquote>"I am convinced that God does not play dice."</blockquote>

                                    In his gap year Jack went to Vegas with some friends who were keen gamblers. He stumbled into a high stakes gambling tournament, mistaken for one of the participants because of an expensive suit given to him by his grandfather.<br>
                                    The match was in fact a controlled game in which Ruby Keeler Milne and the Les Apaches were trying to identify an undercover cop while swindling a business tycoon. Jack is spotted and Ruby is very irritated but ignores him to focus on the game. Meanwhile Jack, inspired by the antics of his friends, tries to scam the businessman who immediately spots the trick and escapes, ruining the Apache’s gig.<br>
                                    Ruby is exceptionally annoyed by Jack and curses him with bad luck, tossing him out of the club where some Apaches beat him up. A few days he leaves Vegas with his friends.<br><br>
                                    Years later, hitchhiking across America Jack Kitchin ended up in Las Vegas. He hadn’t returned since his last visit, so when he was thrown out of a pickup truck in the middle of Sin City he was forced to improvise.<br><br>

                                    <div class="drop-down-box" id="kitchin">
                                        Jack went to the nearest casino and bet his $48 in a game of poker. However, he was no match for even the beginners in Vegas and had soon lost all his money and some. Kitchin crawled out the toilet window to escape and was beaten up by the security guard waiting outside. Jack spent the night in the police station.<br><br>
                                        The next morning he was spoken to by a stoned gambling counsellor, given $100 and sent on his way. He worked in a fast food shop for a few weeks, earning money to keep travelling.<br>
                                        Eventually he was stocked up and ready to move on. He bought a phone and called his family back in Sydney. Not having heard from him in weeks they were elated to hear from him but urged him to fly back home for his brother’s wedding, which had been pushed forward due to an accidental pregnancy.<br><br>
                                        Jack caught a cab to the airport and tried to book a ticket for home but he was one dollar short and no one wanted to give him any money. So he stole some from a wishing well and returned to the booking desk. Unfortunately, while he was looking for money his plane had left and the next one was delayed until the next day. He arrived late for the wedding but rushed for the church nonetheless, arriving even later due to heavy traffic.<br><br>
                                        The church was empty except for a priest and a young man who introduces himself as Cole Johnson and is revealed to be the Cosmologist. Being the only people in the church Jack and Cole (aware of Ruby’s curse and the future importance of Jack) talk.<br>
                                        After a long discussion Cole grants Jack the power of probability manipulation, intending to use Jack to help get back at Ruby, with whom he has a personal vendetta and recognising Jack’s potential in aiding his cause.<br>
                                        Jack was overjoyed with his new power and after a brief family reunion and a half-hearted promise to Cole to use it well, he heads back to Las Vegas.<br><br>
                                        Finally master of his own fortunes and eager to ‘beat’ Vegas Jack exploits his power to win enormous sums of money and enjoys the high life by assorting with the lowlife. Jack’s newfound luck sees him dating four women at once and rolling in money, with a posse of bodyguards at his side.<br>
                                        During this time he bought an antique Sedgley OSS at an auction, fascinated by the weapon. He had it modified and it became his signature possession. Very quickly Jack had become one of the kings of Vegas.<br>
                                        But it was not to last. Jack wasn’t aware of his power’s limitations. He had become too cocky and challenged Red Pig, another gambling tycoon, to a game of poker. Showing off, Jack went all in with everything he had, despite having terrible cards. He tried to use his power to make Red Pig fold, but unbeknownst to Jack, because the probability was far too low it didn’t work. Kitchin started bleeding profusely from his nose and was struck by a devastating headache. Dizzy and on the verge of fainting Jack watched as Red Pig revealed his cards and took all of Jack’s hard earned fortune.<br>
                                        Then Jack fainted.<br><br>
                                        Cole found him in hospital and scolded Jack for misusing his powers and breaking his promise. Jack meekly apologised and Cole ordered him to return to Sydney to fulfil his side of their deal.
                                        Jack took what little of his success was left and travelled home with Cole to try and use his powers for good.<br>

                                    As a young man in the 1940’s Cole lived in Paris. He had just returned from the war and as was his disposition, fell in love with a man, Raphael. <br>
                                    As young Parisian intellectuals they found their way into the social elite and mingling with philosophers, scientists and writers.<br><br>
                                    One evening, they found themselves in one of the local bars accompanied by a group of musicians. The bar was run by Les Apaches, of which the musicians were a part. Head of that society was Ruby Keeler-Milne.<br>
                                    The full bar and summer night had all in good spirits. Cole and Raphael slunk outside for a private moment (homosexuality was frowned upon by the French elite). Little did they know that one the most outspoken homophobes was watching from a balcony above. Ruby Keeler-Milne, (also leader of the street gang by the same name [Les Apaches]) saw the lovers and was appalled.<br>
                                    So she sent one of her men down and had Raphael shot. Cole was kept alive and ordered to spread the word that gays weren’t allowed in Ruby’s Paris. He was beaten, scolded and sent on his way.<br><br>
                                    Cole realised that it really was Ruby’s Paris, she controlled both the elite and the underworld, so he left. Before leaving he snuck back to the bar to retrieve Raphael’s body, which he wrapped in blankets and carried through the streets of Paris.<br>

                                    <div class="drop-down-box" id="cole">
                                        He buried his lover’s body outside a church in the Parisian countryside with the help of the priest, an old man by the name of Father Hargreaves.<br>
                                        Having nowhere else to go, Cole took up residence in the church and the two men soon became friends. Cole’s passion for science and philosophy was challenged by the father’s passion for religion. Hargreaves had an avid interest for all manner of faiths, though Christianity was his calling.<br>
                                        Together they read, worked, taught and preached and two years passed in contentedness. Yet the priest gradually did less and less, until the winter of the second year when he finally caved in.<br>
                                        Father Hargreaves was confined to bed and Cole took over the day-to-day running of the church, praying for his health. He prayed in vain.<br><br>
                                        On his deathbed Father Hargreaves took off his ring and gave it to Cole. It was a smooth gold band wrapped around a tiny gemstone, coloured like an opal, but with a million tiny points of colour.<br>
                                        On his deathbed, the priest told Cole that he was two hundred years old, one of the last in a dying group, blessed with the powers of creation to do the work of the gods. The ring was a power centre, he explained, but not the source of his power. That, he believed, came from the gods.<br><br>
                                        Understandably sceptical, Cole trudged through the winter drizzle and buried Hargreaves in the graveyard alongside Raphael. Having placed the priest in the grave he looked up from his work to see several men and women standing around him.<br>
                                        Uncaring, Cole finished burying the priest and threw down his shovel, heading back into the church. He opened the church doors to see the mourners inside, dry and silent but for a mutter that ominous, echoed through the pews, ‘he found an heir.’<br>
                                        Cole started forward but found himself unable to move, watching as the mourners slowly left whispering, some in languages he understood: ‘what a shame,’ ‘how unfortunate,’ and as the last of them left ‘she’s here.’<br><br>
                                        With that, Cole’s paralysis ended and he collapsed onto the church floor as boot heels clicked up the stairs outside. Ruby Keeler-Milne entered the church, took one look at Cole and left, leaving a trail of mud on the wooden floor.<br>
                                        Cole staggered to his feet and rushed outside into the rain leaping at Ruby. He fell face-first in the mud. Looking up, he saw hundreds of copies of Ruby surrounding him.<br>
                                        He felt heat and looked down to see his ring sinking into the mud and he snatched for it but was dragged backwards by the illusions of Ruby while the real Ruby reached for the ring.<br>
                                        The moment she touched it time froze. A perfect silence began and the universe seemed to shrink and become distant as Cole and Ruby, unaffected, reached for the ring. Cole spotted a similar ring on Ruby’s hand a second (or an hour) before both shattered and the universe burst back to life. Ruby fell back and Cole grabbed the marble sized gemstone, which had replaced the rings in the mud.<br>
                                        He stuffed it in his pocket and lay back panting as Ruby stumbled to her car and glared at him, driving away furiously.<br><br>
                                        Years passed. Cole stayed in the church for many of them. He read Father Hargreaves’ journals, gardened and ran the church but it wasn’t the same, and he didn’t feel like a priest. Over this time, Cole also slowly became familiar with his newfound powers and discovered what he was capable of.<br>
                                        Soon Cole became restless, eager to see the world and learn more about it and his power.
                                        He travelled far and wide and he saw and learnt much. He saw the future and he understood the past but as the world moved forward he moved with it and as science did the same he found some explanations for what he was.<br><br>
                                        At the turn of the century Cole arrived in Sydney and finding no other interdimensionals there, decided to stay, making a fresh start in a city he could watch over, a city where he had forseen much was to happen.<br>

Interestingly Cole twists the traditional dynamic by having religion challenge his faith in science, rather than vice versa as is typical. Cole also twists expectations in his appearance as a young hipster rather than the old man typical for the wizard character.</li>               <li>As Cole learns more about the bleak universe and adopts a more existential view,  a prominent concept becomes his connection to religion as a means to understand and find hope in an uncaring universe. This parallels the same journey made by Father Hargreaves, whose fascination with religion allowed him to find a purpose.</li>
                                                <li>As a central character in Jack’s storyline, Cole also parallels him, both having been wronged by Ruby and granted their powers by an older, wiser benefactor. </li>

                                    <blockquote>"Belief in the absence of illusions is itself an illusion."</blockquote>

                                    In 1897 Ruby was born into a peasant family in a small German village. Her father left early so she grew up under the care of her mother, a resilient and determined woman.<br>
                                    At age 17, with the outbreak of the First World War, Ruby felt a need to combat the overwhelming masculinity of the war along with the expectations of her community. She cut her hair and enlisted in the army, setting out to prove she was just as capable as anyone.<br><br>
                                    She skilfully deceived her comrades and higher ups, fighting in the war for three long years until, fighting in France, she found herself stuck behind enemy lines after a failed infiltration mission.<br>
                                    Ruby was soon captured by a fireteam of American soldiers and was raped. The cavalry didn’t come. This, for the most impactful time in her life showed her the failure of humanity and began that philosophy central to her character, existentialism.<br>
                                    Ruby was taken back to a prisoner of war camp, forced to care for the wounded. Here she met another woman, Nurse Roth, who she became unwilling friends with.<br>
                                    As the war drew to a close she told Roth about her rape and Roth, seeing a chance to continue her legacy and give Ruby back the dignity and power she had lost gave Ruby a ring, and like Father Hargreaves, passed on her power to the first of a new generation of interdimensionals. And that was how Ruby gained the ability to bend the first three dimensions to her will.<br><br>

                                    <div class="drop-down-box" id="ruby">
                                        By the time the war had drawn to a close, a powerful Ruby had arrived in Paris, determined to lead a new life of which she was in command. Having come to the realisation that to her all that mattered was her own success she was ready to do so; in spectacular fashion.<br>
                                        Over the coming years she tried several approaches to gain the influence she sought and eventually, making the most of a fortunate coincidence, drew together the Les Apaches (one part a gang of street thugs, the other a society of writers and musicians, both of which had chosen the same name). Ruby infiltrated both groups and adopted positions of power in each, allowing her to gradually integrate them by mixing and matching members and events, blurring the two groups into one and granting her control over both Paris' poor and aristocracy.<br><br>
                                        Then came the night that set the Cosmologist on his path. At the Les Apaches club in Paris Ruby had Cole's lover, Raphael, shot. This was the first time she had killed someone outside of war. At this point, a council ran the Les Apaches, and Ruby having manoeuvred to control a sizeable portion of the gang, was forced to appeal to them to retain her command.<br>
                                        The meeting was going unsuccessfully, with the Apaches challenging Ruby’s capacity to lead, with strong sexist undertones. Finding it necessary to keep them alive to stabilise the gang Ruby was forced to prove herself to them. Noticing Cole and Raphael in the courtyard she feigned nonchalantly ordered Raphael killed, succeeding in impressing the Apache leaders by displaying her commitment and ruthlessness.<br>
                                        Despite her apparent nonchalance the act took a toll on Ruby’s conscience, solidifying her commitment to her new lifestyle and preluding her view of people as means to an end.<br><br>
                                        Over these years her power grew, and she met and was feared by other interdimensionals, including Father Hargreaves, whose funeral she attended, clashing with Cole in the process. Cole unwittingly destroyed Ruby's ring, severely limiting her power.<br>
                                        Growing sick of Paris, eager to get her strength back, and wary of retaliation by Cole, Ruby left, travelling with some of the Les Apaches to Las Vegas.<br>
                                        In Vegas she sought out Weaver, a cosmic entity with the capacity to manipulate the higher dimensions. Weaver, fallen on hard times in the big city, agreed to work for Ruby (who at least had a vision) in exchange for a sizeable income stream (Weaver was a keen drug-user and loved the simple satisfaction of money).<br><br>
                                        In Vegas Keeler-Milne set up another base of operations for the Apaches, who worked the casino scene to raise money for their operations in both Paris and Vegas.<br>
                                        Setting out on her own, Ruby hunted interdimensionals across America, killing them and stealing whatever power sources they had.<br>
                                        Returning to Vegas she had Weaver create her dress from the power sources she had collected. With her power and more returned, Ruby was satisfied and stayed in Vegas; ensuring operations went smoothly and Weaver didn’t go rogue. Then Will arrived.<br><br>
                                        As a Sydney politician he had come to Vegas on a business trip and Ruby saw an opportunity. Forced to come to one of her casinos to please a support group he met Ruby and was smitten. Seizing the chance, Ruby slid him into the palm of her hand and within days found herself in one of the most powerful positions in Sydney, the new frontier for her formidable empire.<br>

                                                <li>Ruby’s central theme is of the empowerment of women. She is self-made, remarkably resilient, and hugely independent.
                                                    Her decision to fight in WWI shows that commitment to independence, as well as reflecting the idea of illusions and deception prominent in her story.<br>
                                                    Her rape marks one of the most disturbing and important events for her character. The fact that it occurred at the hands of the supposed good guys (the Allies) dramatically highlights the ambiguity of war, particularly World War I (which was a sort of uber-masculine atrocity contest). This, the fact that even the ‘good guys’ can do such severe wrong, leads to Ruby’s outlook on humanity as well as foreshadowing Cole’s actions at the conclusion of Jack Stage 1.<br>
                                                    Her outlook on humanity is fairly complex. Essentially, she sees people as tools, unaware of themselves and others. Her rape was a direct attack on her moral compass, leaving her confused and hopeless, unsure about morality and horrified at the damage individuals can do.<br>
                                                    All of this combined to create her existentialism, a feeling of hopeless in a universe where her actions will not be judged by any heavenly power (her rejection of religion contrasting Cole and Hargreaves’ acceptance and strength of it), and therefore no consequences for any actions. This also helps explain her disregard for human-life for in an uncaring universe nothing is sacred.<br>
                                                    Since that atrocity and her attempt to hide her femininity during the war she embraced it and lived the rest of her life parading it, in the light of her accomplishments and great influence.

                                    Will had always felt a profound and genuine duty to make the world a better place. Compassionate, egalitarian and recognising his high quality of life and potential, Will decided early on that he had a duty to throw himself head-first into Australia’s political battleground.<br>
                                    It is a testament to Will’s character that he was able to do this, for politics is undoubtedly a relentless and soul-destroying enterprise. But Will had sworn to himself that he would not be swayed, that despite all opposition he would remain true to himself and his goal, to create a political system that inspired hope.<br><br>
                                    Salkeld applied himself hard and found a position in the Labour Party. Despite the pressure, Will’s negotiation skills helped him gain a range of supporters in key electorates, allowing him to become an important member of the party without making moral sacrifices.<br>
                                    Then, in 2020, Will was elected into the House of Representatives and he was finally able to begin properly working to his goal.<br><br>
                                    In parliament, Will works furiously to do what little he can to bring about change and he has had some small but significant victories: tweaking the wording of bills, swaying votes, covering up beneficial laws and acting as a de facto negotiator between parties.<br>
                                    But everything became much more complicated when on a business trip in Las Vegas Will Salkeld met Ruby Keeler-Milne and fell head over heels in love. Ruby saw an opportunity and Will brought her back to Sydney, unaware of the force he was unleashing on his beloved city.<br><br><br>

                                When discrimination against Asians began, Nick, then a promising young lawyer, helped his friends Tongyi Shen and Jonathan Pan seek refuge in Chinatown. Here they happened upon a hidden Chinese syndicate, the Longying. Seeking protection and a means to empower themselves they joined their cause and spent years training there and immersing themselves in the syndicate.<br><br>
                                During this time he lived in an apartment in Chinatown and completed his training as a lawyer, having long had a passion for the profession.
                                However, as he worked in the business corruption became very evident and Nick was appalled. Coupled with this, due to his race, his work was made very difficult by the government and some of his coworkers, forcing himself to push himself hard to achieve anything.<br><br>
                                Over this time the Longying became more powerful and conditions across the rest of Sydney worsened. Eventually Nick became so distraught with the state of the legal system he stopped his Longying training to commit to his profession and overcome the obstacles presented by his ethnicity.<br>
                                While he was away a US raid crippled the Longying and Nick became furious.
                                With the help of close friends, he put together his arsenal and left to become one of the first vigilantes, Viper.<br><br><br>

                                Tongyi fled with his friends, Nick and Jonathan, to Chinatown when severe discrimination began. They remained in Chinatown as it was established as an Asian safe zone.
                                They stumbled upon the Longying and joined the group. While Nick and Jonathan trained, Tongyi took on an administrative role and helped establish connections for the Longying, preferring it to a combat role.<br><br>
                                He spent years working in restaurants across Chinatown and eventually opened his own restaurant outside of Chinatown. This restaurant was opened in Surry Hills and named the Lucky Moon.<br><br>
                                Tongyi then proceeded to link his restaurant to the Longying’s tunnel system allowing his restaurant to act as a base of operations and exit from Chinatown. Tongyi has been very careful to remain in the good graces of authorities and takes extra precautions when helping the Longying.<br>
                                He is a very close friend of Viper and looks out for his vigilante friend. Tongyi often advises and helps ground Viper though they are known to argue.

                                    <blockquote>"One who confounds good and evil is an enemy to good."</blockquote>

                                    Hannah always assumed she would never be able to be a firefighter. She came to terms with the fact that it was just a dream. She was too short for recruitment and a career as a firefighter seeming worlds away from her walk in life. Resigned, she began studying psychology at university.<br>
                                    Midway through her second year Fire and Rescue NSW set up a stall at a university open day. With a severe bushfire season anticipated, FRNSW sought to up their numbers in preparation for the summer of 2026. Seeing an opportunity to follow her dream, and somewhat disengaged from the demanding psychology course, she took a chance and filed an application.<br>
                                    And it was at the recruitment stall that she met Max Davison. As the very image of the strapping firefighter (a career perk that certainly hadn’t hindered Hannah’s interest in it) he immediately caught Hannah’s attention and they spoke at length. She learnt that he was an instructor for and leader of the local fire brigade. Pleased that he’d be teaching her if her application were successful, Hannah invested herself in it. She was elated when she was accepted.<br><br>
                                    With her lifelong dream coming true, and having quit her university course, Hannah fully committed to her training. Over the thirteen-week course she was trained in all aspects of firefighting, enduring theory and gruelling drills to learn the skills she would rely on in her new line of work.<br>
                                    As her skills developed so too did her relationship with Davison. Hannah thoroughly impressed him with her application to and above average performance in the course and at his suggestion they nervously began to spend time together outside of work.<br><br>
                                    By December Hannah was a fully-fledged firefighter, employed alongside her now romantic partner Max, and with a degree of experience under her belt. But the summer heated up and the fires got worse, yet over Christmas and New Years there was nothing, just dry, sweltering days, the whole nation praying there would be no spark. Their prayers were not answered for by the 24th of January raging bushfires had erupted across the state. In a natural disaster rivalling Black Saturday, the skies turned black with smoke and in the country thousands were forced to flee their homes. Into this devastation Hannah was sent.<br>
                                    They fought the fires night and day. The heat was unbearable, the smoke unrelenting and the destruction unimaginable. Some people they saved, others they could not. The battle went on for weeks. Sweating, soot covered, burned and coughing, Hannah, like all her fellow firefighters, was beyond her physical limit, running on adrenaline and willpower alone. Understaffed even despite their recruitment efforts the FRNSW was struggling to cope and by February 19th there had been 200 casualties. All this time it had barely rained and conditions showed no signs of changing. It was a war of attrition that they were losing.<br><br>
                                    Physically unable to continue, Hannah and Max’s platoon was granted a week of rest in the nearby town of Lithgow. Hannah understood that it was necessary but felt guilty and ashamed nonetheless, aghast that lives were being lost and she was unable to do anything but stand idly by.<br>
                                    But their rest was cut short as a wind steered a branch of the closest fire directly towards Lithgow (a well population mining town and transport hub). Back on the battlefront Hannah’s platoon was immediately set to work coordinating the evacuation and preparing to defend the town. Cut off from most supply lines by the fire they were under resourced and on their last legs.<br>
                                    They held the fire at bay for a day but the wind ensured it was not subdued and soon another fire cut off Lithgow altogether, surrounding the town by bushfire on all sides. The residents who had not yet managed to evacuate sought shelter in the supermarket, holding up in the freezer room to escape the heat, though the power had failed hours ago. But help was on the way; Max had contacted FRNSW from the police station and reinforcements were inbound.<br>
                                    By this time the fire had set most of Lithgow alight and Davison made the call that the town was lost and the firefighters would evacuate with the remaining twenty or so residents. They fought the fire in the streets for the next half hour until rescue helicopters arrived, water bombing to clear a road for fire engines to evacuate the trapped survivors.<br><br>
                                    As the last of the fire trucks loaded up survivors and made their escape; the walls of the supermarket lapping with flames, a woman, delirious from smoke inhalation, cried out for her baby, her cry barely audible over the sirens and roaring fire. As the truck raced away along the scorched road and the last of the firefighters prepared to leave, Hannah abruptly realised that the baby had been left behind. She raced over to Max and explained the situation, asking for him to help her search for the baby. He steadfastly refused. Utterly betrayed, and ignoring his shout of protest, Hannah raced back into the burning supermarket.<br>
                                    She was exhausted, charred and weak but Hannah forced herself through the thick smoke and flames regardless. Choking on ash and with vision blurred she made her way to the freezer aisle, spurred on by some mysterious energy. Breaking in the door with her axe she saw a young child, unconscious but mercifully spared, alone in the back of the freezer room.<br>
                                    Feeling a deep sense of accomplishment Hannah was reinvigorated and her exhaustion swept away as she swung the child over her shoulder and collected herself for the fight out. Hacking her way out of the building she was horrified to discover that she had been deserted and she immediately felt weak. Max had left her behind. When it came down to the wire he had abandoned her. Her exhaustion catching up with her, temporary power depleted, Hannah held the child close and headed down the cleared road, bushfire already lunging back across the asphalt. Little did Hannah know that the strength accompanying her rescue of the child had stemmed from the immorality of Max abandoning her, his betrayal inadvertently allowing her to do good.<br><br>
                                    Soon she reached the relative safety of the highway and collapsed, exhausted from her ordeal. Fortunately a family fleeing from fires in the south picked her up, rushing Hannah and the feverish child to the closest hospital. Though the hospital was packed, the pair found safety there.<br><br>
                                    Soon Hannah found herself back in Sydney, secure in the loving arms of her family. Her heroism made the news (though her abandonment was noticeably absent) and FRNSW contacted her, eager to have her back on the force. Hannah opted to take a few weeks off to recover.<br><br>
                                    But trouble was afoot in Sydney. Hundreds of people, displaced by the fires, had fled to the city for shelter and safety. Some of these unfortunates were taken in by family or friends but alienated and facing expensive property prices many more had nowhere to go. Soon a ramshackle community developed in Wentworth Park, a small patch of greenery directly opposite Central Station and already home to a small squatter settlement.<br>
                                    Tensions and conflicts emerged almost instantly, with FRNSW caught in the crossfire. Sydneysiders, annoyed with the influx of rural refugees and the growth of what essentially amounted to a slum opposite one of the city’s major landmarks, vocally criticised the situation. Community leaders voiced anger at the inability of politicians to cater to rapid urbanisation as well climate change stances that had allowed the extreme bushfires to occur.<br>
                                    The refugees also had no shortage of qualms. They were angry at their tragedies being politicised and outraged at the drastic reduction in quality of life. Between this back and forth of criticisms the state’s emergency response team was made a scapegoat, everyone demanding to know why the whole problem couldn’t have been averted if the firefighters had simply done their job and put out the fire, protecting those homes that had been destroyed.<br><br>
                                    As the debate heightened and the new settlement, insensitively dubbed Charcoalville (for both the established Aboriginal community and the new fire-stricken inhabitants), hostilities rose accordingly. Fights broke out around Wentworth Park and pipes supplying clean water to the park were vandalised.<br>
                                    Here Ed Learoyd emerged, exerting his influence to become a de facto spokesperson for those affected by the bushfires, but ultimately only antagonising opponents and further escalating the situation.<br><br>
                                    Attacked from all sides FRNSW played the only card they had, Hannah. Her story was just what they needed to help restore their public image. So they promoted it, broadcasting the story and sending Hannah to work as part of the team tasked with constructing proper dwellings for the new inhabitants of Wentworth Park. Hannah dutifully obliged, annoyed, like all the other firefighters, that their work was being taken for granted by the people they had tried so hard to protect.<br><br>
                                    Exposed to the challenges of life in Charcoalville, Hannah was touched by the plight of the people and thanks to her heroic escapade, was able to build close ties with various members of the community. One in particular, a hippie named Jimena Armstrong, became close friends with Hannah, Armstrong’s unique perspective helping Hannah to understand and make the most of her newfound power.<br>
                                    Able to more readily use her power, Hannah sensed great immorality, not just in Charcoalville but in the entire city; anger, hopelessness and violence weighing heavy on her heart.<br>
                                    Untrusting after her abandonment, feeling responsibility accompanied by her power and job, and spurred on by the apparent success of vigilantes across Sydney, Hannah, urged on by Jimena, became one herself, striking out on her own to cleanse Sydney of its wrongs.

                                Jimena was born into a remarkably average family. She lived the life that was expected of her until the age of fifteen when, arriving home from school one day, she found her house empty, her parents gone. On the kitchen table was a pile of money and a farewell note. Jimena was shocked and appalled to discover that her parents had just upped and left. Craving a life on the road and unable to endure the monotonous city life they had simply left their teenage daughter behind and set out for a ragtag life of adventure.<br>
                                Directionless, she dropped out of school and followed in her parent’s footsteps. Jimena wandered around Australia, then the world, in search of herself. With only as much as she could carry, she improvised her way, surviving through hard work and the kindness of others, particularly other travellers. These likeminded individuals helped Jimena in her search for meaning and herself, offering up their own unique philosophies and worldviews. These people: hippies, gypsies, truckers, farmers, musicians, artists and preachers, shaped Jimena into the woman she would become.<br><br>
                                But everything changed when Jimena became pregnant. In a hostel in Iceland Jimena was anxiously delighted to discover she was going to have a child. Soon realising that her current lifestyle was not fit for a pregnant woman or baby she decided it was time to head for home.<br>
                                Arriving back in Australia Jimena made straight for the Blue Mountains. There, nestled amongst the picturesque landscape, lived a self-sufficient community of hippies, whom she had spent months living with as a teenager. The closest thing she had to home, it was a safe place for her and her unborn son. With smiles and open arms she was taken in and quickly fell back into the lazy rhythms of mountain life.<br>
                                Her son was born, Ray (her ray of sunshine), and raised with great care, Jimena sure to learn from her parent’s mistakes. Then, when Ray was seven the bushfires struck; 2027, Black February. Like so many, Jimena, her son and their community were forced to Sydney and into Charcoalville. In an old minivan on the edge of Belmore Park they made their new home. The hippies brought much needed positivity to the settlement, helping bring the refugees together and spread compassion and optimism.<br><br>
                                It was only natural that she should meet Hannah Kroeger and they soon became close friends, Hannah taking extra care to look out for Jimena and Ray as tensions in Charcoalville escalated.<br>
                                These tensions manifested when a fire was started in the park, set alight by an angry mob of protestors. A fight broke out and in the chaos Ray disappeared. Devastated but determined, Jimena enlisted Hannah’s help to help find her son, never knowing what their search would uncover.<br><br>

                                    <blockquote>"The fisherman knows that the sea is dangerous and the storm is terrible, but he has never found these dangers sufficient reason for staying ashore."</blockquote>

                                In his youth, Luca practiced sailing as a hobby, and gradually developed a passion for the ocean and boats. He eventually decided to find work aboard a boat so he signed up to crew one of the boats ferrying aid and supplies to those affected by the Southeast Asian War. Luca had travelled through Cambodia and Laos as a teenager and had loved the land and the people, so the war deeply disturbed him and he felt he needed to experience it and do what he could to help.<br><br>
                                Little did he realise that the boat he found work on was instead trafficking drugs and arms through Southeast Asia, to profit from the conflict. When Neal discovered the true purpose of the voyage he tried to escape while the boat was docked in Indonesia, only to be captured and imprisoned by the captain of the boat. Luca was flayed and deprived of food for several days, suffering in the brig of the small vessel and labelled a mutineer.<br>
                                Eventually he was released on strict conditions and forced into backbreaking labour aboard the boat. They travelled north into the South China Sea, loaded with a cargo of illegal goods but were soon caught up in the conflict. The ship was captured by Chinese pirates and most of the crew was killed.<br>
                                Luca survived and was forced to continue working on the ship. At a Vietnamese port he once more tried to escape, but was again captured. He had his hand chopped off in punishment before being tossed over the side of the boat when he continued to resist.<br>
                                Luca floated for days on the verge of death, but was eventually picked up by yet another band of rebels. At this point Luca snapped, unable to tolerate his misfortune any longer. In a rage he killed the entire crew, commandeering the vessel for himself. On his last legs Luca was able to perform first aid on himself and set the boat on a course for Ho Chi Minh City.<br>
                                He reached Ho Chi Minh City and managed to find medical attention. As soon as he was better he found some crewmembers and set sail for home, desperate to get as far away from the war as possible.<br><br>
                                Along the way he became increasingly confident captaining the boat and made a reputation for himself on the high seas.<br>
                                However, upon reaching Sydney, Luca tried to integrate back into society, only to be rejected. He felt changed and broken by his experiences in the South China Sea. He soon found himself back on board his boat, rechristened the Solitude, and back on the sea, where he felt safe and even happy.<br>
                                He sailed the seas south of Sydney, fishing in the freezing Antarctic waters and hardening even further, the weather doing its best to break him but only solidifying his sea legs. For years Luca fished, not for the profit but simply because he had nothing better to do. His time in the South China Sea had left him a broken man and he revels in the isolation of his life on the sea, rarely returning to port.<br>
                                Nonetheless, one fateful day Neal did return to port in Sydney. There he was approached by Thomas Orlay with a desperate plea to help save his girlfriend. Bored, adventurous and keen to put his skills to the test, Luca and the Solitude were soon hired. Days later the Mariner was back on the sea, searching for a sea monster.<br><br>

                                    Ben Ly met Luca Neal at the docks in Ho Chi Minh City where Ly was stopped over while his current captain deposited goods at the docks.<br>
                                    Ly had found employment as a fisherman after he was dishonoured in his home village as a teenager. When he was found to be gay his family, belonging to an extremely traditional community, were ashamed, and disowned him in favour of his 4 brothers and sisters.<br>
                                    Ly was not distraught for he had always felt uncomfortable in the village and had a great desire to see the world. So he took this loss under his wing and travelled across Vietnam, finding odd jobs here and there before he finally reached Ho Chi Minh City and took a job on a fishing boat.<br>
                                    Ly spent the rest of his youth as a fisherman and while scorned by fellow Vietnamese for his exile, his diligence and hard work gained him much respect among his fellow sailors.<br>
                                    As an older man, Ly was known for his breadth of knowledge and sailing skills so it came as a great shock to his then captain when Ben quit, on an impulse to join Neal’s crew. Luca was equally surprised but was glad for anyone he could get, especially since Ly brought great prestige and guaranteed him respect.They set sail for Sydney soon after and Ly’s help was invaluable to the Mariner on the voyage home, the two men forming a tight bond.<br>
                                    When Luca arrived in Sydney and abandoned his boat to try and resettle, Ly waited patiently with the boat, his experience reassuring him that Luca would return, which he soon did. Ly had the ship ready and the FV Solitude soon set sail, venturing down into the cold waters of the Southern Ocean.
